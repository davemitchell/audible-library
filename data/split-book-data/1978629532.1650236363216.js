window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In the bestselling tradition of <i>The Silence of the Lambs </i>comes <i>The Tower</i>, a novel of nail-biting suspense and heart-stopping terror played out in a psychological battle of wit, cunning, and pure evil between a diabolically clever killer and his determined hunter.</p> <p>Allander Atlasia is an infamous psychopath whose heinous crimes have earned him a lifetime stay at the Tower (nicknamed Alcatraz II), the world's most extreme maximum-security prison. But after a brilliant and brutal escape, the criminal mastermind begins a killing spree that is intensely personal - one by one, victims fall prey to a twisted and chilling re-enactment of his own depraved past.</p> <p>Jade Marlow is an ex-FBI profiler and tracker whose fearlessness is only surpassed by the severity of his own inner demons. With a record of irrational behavior and a genius for putting himself into the mind of a criminal predator, he may be the one man diabolical enough to catch Atlasia. In an escalating contest of wills and wits, two equally defiant men race toward a showdown where daring is deadly and failure is fatal.</p>";
