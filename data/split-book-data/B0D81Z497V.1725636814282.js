window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>William Kent Krueger—“a master storyteller at the top of his game” (Kristin Hannah)—returns with a breathtaking new novel in his New York Times bestselling Cork O’Connor series.<br> <br> After the teenage daughter of a prominent Minnesota politician goes missing, a huge manhunt is launched to find her. But when Cork O’Connor’s grandson Waaboo stumbles across the shallow grave of a young Ojibwe woman while hunting blueberries, nobody seems to care. Nobody, that is, except Cork and the newly formed Iron Lake Ojibwe Tribal Police Department. As Cork and the tribal officers dig into the circumstances of her murder, they discover a link to the missing girl that suggests these are not isolated incidents, but evidence of something much more sinister.<br> <br> Already, tensions in the small town of Aurora, Minnesota, are high as residents gather to protest an oil pipeline that is being constructed through the pristine forests sacred to the Ojibwe at a place known as Spirit Crossing. In the meantime, little Waaboo, who has a unique connection with the dead woman, has become a target for the killers, and Cork’s daughter, Annie, has returned home with a secret that threatens to tear the family apart. The closer Cork gets to finding the answers he seeks, the more he fears for the people he loves.</p>";
