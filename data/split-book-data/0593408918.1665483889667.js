window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Sheriff Quinn Colson and his former deputy Lillie Virgil find themselves on opposite sides of a case for the first time after a woman is found dead and three delinquent teens go on the run.</b></p> <p>Before he was an army ranger who came home to become Tibbehah County Sheriff and take down a corrupt system, Quinn Colson was a kid who got into trouble - a lot of it. So when juvenile delinquent TJ Byrd insists that she doesn’t know who killed her mother - an unreliable addict who has disappeared - Quinn’s inclined to believe her. But no one else does - not the town, not the sheriff in a neighboring county, not her mother’s older boyfriend, and certainly not Quinn’s friend and former deputy, US Marshal Lillie Virgil.</p> <p>The Byrd family has always been trouble, and 16-year-old TJ is known for petty theft, fighting, and general hell-raising. She’s also no fool, and when she senses she’s about to take the fall for her mother’s murder, TJ, her boyfriend, her best friend, and her nine-year-old brother go on the run. As Lillie Virgil tracks the kids across a trail of burglaries, stolen cars, and even a kidnapping, intent on bringing TJ to justice, Quinn sets out to find the truth back in Tibbehah. Someone has gone to a lot of violent trouble to make TJ and her friends the logical target of the investigation. It’s easy, and who cares about a bunch of lawless kids?</p> <p>As the bloody evidence against TJ piles up, Quinn knows someone truly evil is at work here - and that puts TJ and her friends in more danger than they can imagine.</p>";
