window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>With the walls closing in, Navy SEAL sniper James Reece is on a race to dismantle a conspiracy that has forced America to her knees in the latest high-octane thriller that seems ripped from the headlines from the “hottest author on the thriller scene today” (</b><b><i>The Real Book Spy</i></b><b>), #1 </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestseller Jack Carr.</b><br> <br> You think you know James Reece. Think again.<br> <br> A storm is on the horizon. America’s days are numbered. A Chinese submarine has gone rogue and is navigating towards the continental United States, putting its nuclear missiles within striking distance of the West Coast.<br> <br> A rising Silicon Valley tech mogul with unknown allegiances is at the forefront of a revolution in quantum computing and Artificial Intelligence.<br> <br> A politician controlled by a foreign power is a breath away from the Oval Office.<br> <br> Three seemingly disconnected events are on a collision course to ignite a power grab unlike anything the world has ever seen.<br> <br> The country’s only hope is a quantum computer that has gone dark, retreating to the deepest levels of the internet, learning at a rate inconceivable at her inception. But during her time in hiding, she has done more than learn. She has become a weapon. She is now positioned to act as either the country’s greatest savior or its worst enemy. She is known as “Alice” and her only connection to the outside world is to a former Navy SEAL sniper named James Reece who has left the violence of his past life behind.<br> <br> Will there be blood?<br> <br> Count on it!<br> <br> Will the forces that threaten to destroy the United States be enough to light the fuse of Reece’s resurrection? From “master novelist” (<i>Ballistic </i>magazine) Jack Carr comes his most intense thriller to date, pressing “emotional buttons that other writers wouldn’t dare explore” (<i>The Real Book Spy</i>).</p>";
