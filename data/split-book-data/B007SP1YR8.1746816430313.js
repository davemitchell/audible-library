window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The “Prey” novels by Pulitzer prize-winning journalist John Sandford consistently make the best seller lists, but they are not for the faint of heart. Featuring Minneapolis Lieutenant Lucas Davenport, these thrillers are raw, graphic, and impossible to put down. In <i>Eyes of Prey</i>, a depressed and unfocused Davenport takes on a macabre case, tracking down a serial killer who maims the eyes of his victims after he has murdered them.</p>";
