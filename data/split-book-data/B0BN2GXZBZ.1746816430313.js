She is pretty, feminine, assertive and a guy’s guy kind of girl, who smokes cigars and drinks whisky with the best of’em. Everybody loves her; but nobody has heard of her till now and she has an uphill fight against some experienced heavy hitters. But that’s not her biggest problem.</p> <p>Her biggest problem is a list; a list that includes members of the executive as well as senators, bankers and businessmen, Israeli officials, and her. And one by one everyone on that list is dying.</p> <p>Mason and Gallin are assigned to protect her and find the authors of the list. At first it seems a simple enough task, until, after a particularly gruesome killing, Mason finds the other half of the list; the half no one knew existed, the half he is on.</p> <p>Then things get heavy….</p>";
