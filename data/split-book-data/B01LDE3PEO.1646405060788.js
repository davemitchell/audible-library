window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Noah Wolf is one of the world's most deadly assassins, completely devoid of emotion and conscience. These factors, which others would consider to be handicaps, allow him to evaluate situations instantly, and from a purely logical standpoint. His decisions and actions are never tainted by emotion or feelings, which frees him from any risk of fear or guilt. </p> <p>When Team Camelot is handed an unusual mission to rescue the abducted daughter of a foreign president, Noah and the rest go into it with confidence, and are quickly successful. Back home, they are ready to celebrate, but something doesn't feel right. The mission was too easy, and there are indicators that someone may have discovered who they are and tracked them back to Neverland. Noah's house is entered while the team is away, and he is unable to shake the feeling that the mission was nothing but a ruse to expose E &amp; E. </p> <p>It doesn't take long for him to decide that they must return to the field, their new mission to track down a Russian counterpart of their own Allison Peterson. Nicolaich Andropov has marked Noah for termination, so Noah decides to use himself as bait to draw the man into a trap. Unfortunately, Andropov is known as a ghost, a man whose appearance is unknown, able to move in absolute secrecy and remain several steps ahead of any who pursue him. When Noah fails to recognize this fact, Sarah becomes a hostage and pawn in a battle to the death. There's only one tiny chance to save her, but it will mean Noah must go unarmed and alone to meet his nemesis. The game is on, with his own life and Sarah's as the prize. </p>";
