Read it once for the plot; read it again for the beauty and subtlety of French's writing.\" (Sarah Lyall, </b><b><i>The New York Times</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p>Cal Hooper thought a fixer-upper in a bucolic Irish village would be the perfect escape. After 25 years in the Chicago police force and a bruising divorce, he just wants to build a new life in a pretty spot with a good pub where nothing much happens. But when a local kid whose brother has gone missing arm-twists him into investigating, Cal uncovers layers of darkness beneath his picturesque retreat, and starts to realize that even small towns shelter dangerous secrets.</p> <p>\"One of the greatest crime novelists writing today\" (<i>Vox</i>) weaves a masterful, atmospheric tale of suspense, asking how to tell right from wrong in a world where neither is simple, and what we stake on that decision.</p>";
