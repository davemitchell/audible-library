Her mission is to persuade nuclear physicist Stanislav Kalashnik to defect and bring his knowledge of Russian weapons back to the UK. On the verge of success, the operation fails suddenly and spectacularly.</p> <p>Seventeen years later, Kalashnik is Chief Engineer at the power plant near Pripyat known as Chernobyl. His concerns for the safety of the plant are growing. When his views lead to accusations that question his patriotism, he finds himself in a very risky position.</p> <p>Meanwhile, back in London, Eloise Shepherd's life and career are spinning out of control when she's approached with a one-time offer to redeem herself. The mission: to get Kalashnik over Soviet borders once more. It's an opportunity that could change everything and Eloise knows there's no reward without risk.
