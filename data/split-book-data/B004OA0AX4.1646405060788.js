window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Leonid McGill is back, in the third-and most enthralling and ambitious-installment in Walter Mosley's latest <i>New York Times</i> best-selling series. </p> <p>The economy has hit the private-investigator business hard, even for the detective designated as \"a more than worthy successor to Philip Marlowe\" (<i>The Boston Globe</i>) and \"the perfect heir to Easy Rawlins\" (Toronto <i> Globe and Mail</i>). Lately, Leonid McGill is getting job offers only from the criminals he's worked so hard to leave behind. </p> <p>Meanwhile, his life grows ever more complicated: his favorite stepson, Twill, drops out of school for mysteriously lucrative pursuits; his best friend, Gordo, is diagnosed with cancer and is living on Leonid's couch; his wife takes a new lover, infuriating the old one and endangering the McGill family; and Leonid's girlfriend, Aura, is back but intent on some serious conversations.... </p> <p>So how can he say no to the beautiful young woman who walks into his office with a stack of cash? She's an artist, she tells him, who's escaped from poverty via marriage to a rich collector who keeps her on a stipend. But she says she fears for her life, and needs Leonid's help. Though Leonid knows better than to believe every word, this isn't a job he can afford to turn away, even as he senses that - if his family's misadventures don't kill him first - sorting out the woman's crooked tale will bring him straight to death's door.</p>";
