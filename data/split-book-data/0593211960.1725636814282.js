With the help of his new wife, Maggie, rehabilitation, and sheer force of will, he's walking again, eager to resume his work as a Southern lawman and track down those responsible for his attempted murder. But someone is standing in his way: an interim sheriff, appointed by the newly elected Governor Vardaman, the man who Quinn knows ordered his murder.
