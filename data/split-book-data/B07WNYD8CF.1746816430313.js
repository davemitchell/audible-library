window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Success doesn’t come easily for us. We long for a better life and to make a difference. But days turn into weeks, then months, then years. And the dreams we once had seem to fade away. We wonder about ourselves: \"What am I doing wrong?”</p> <p>If you’ve ever felt discouraged, worn out, or let down, you have chosen the right book. What you are about to listen could be the best and the most helpful audiobook you could've ever listened to. Because, while a rare group of people seem to live with instant success and significance, the vast majority of us don’t. Having a bulletproof mindset is the key to having that success. I’m not an overnight success story. In fact, my story is quite the opposite. But I was persistent and dedicated. And with the mindsets I highlight in this book, something amazing happened to me...and it can happen to you, too.</p> <p>Get ready to take control of your mindset and become bulletproof.</p>";
