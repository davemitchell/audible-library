window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Ten years ago, Craig Johnson wrote his first short story, the Hillerman Award-winning \"Old Indian Trick\". This was one of the earliest appearances of the sheriff who would go on to star in Johnson’s best-selling, award-winning novels and the A&amp;E hit series <i>Longmire</i>. Each Christmas Eve thereafter, fans rejoiced when Johnson sent out a new short story featuring an episode in Walt’s life that doesn’t appear in the novels; over the years, many have asked why they can’t buy the stories in book form. <i>Wait for Signs</i> collects those beloved stories - and one entirely new story, \"Petunia, Bandit Queen of the Bighorns\" - for the very first time in a single volume, regular trade hardcover. With glimpses of Walt’s past from the incident in \"Ministerial Aide\", when the sheriff is mistaken for a deity, to the hilarious \"Messenger\", where the majority of the action takes place in a Port-A-Potty, <i>Wait for Signs</i> is a necessary addition to any <i>Longmire</i> fan’s shelf and a wonderful way to introduce new readers to the fictional world of Absaroka County, Wyoming.</p>";
