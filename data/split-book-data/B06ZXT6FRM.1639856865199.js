window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This is the tale of Myr Sevii, a young woman who discovers a field that suppresses static electrical effects and warps space in a fashion that attracts protons. It's a hard science fiction exploration of what might happen if you were able to pull protons into a tiny volume and - having suppressed static repulsion - crush them together. The story examines how this new discovery affects Myr and will soon affect the world around her. </p> <p>Changes abound in the company Myr works for, in the people around her, and in her family. So many unexpected technological revolutions are happening at the same time that it's hard for Myr and her friends to come to grips with them. </p> <p>When word of the inventions gets out, vultures gather - wanting the tech for themselves. </p> <p>Some of those people will kill to get what they want.... </p>";
