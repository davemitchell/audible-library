The “utterly addictive” (</b><b><i>The New York Times</i></b><b>) series continues as acclaimed author Lee Child teams up with his brother, Andrew Child, fellow thriller writer extraordinaire.</b></p> <p><b>“One of the many great things about Jack Reacher is that he’s larger than life while remaining relatable and believable. </b><b><i>The Sentinel</i></b><b> shows that two Childs are even better than one.”—James Patterson</b></p> <p>As always, Reacher has no particular place to go, and all the time in the world to get there. One morning he ends up in a town near Pleasantville, Tennessee.</p> <p>But there’s nothing pleasant about the place.</p> <p>In broad daylight Reacher spots a hapless soul walking into an ambush. “It was four against one”&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. so Reacher intervenes, with his own trademark brand of conflict resolution.</p> <p>The man he saves is Rusty Rutherford, an unassuming IT manager, recently fired after a cyberattack locked up the town’s data, records, information&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and secrets. Rutherford wants to stay put, look innocent, and clear his name.</p> <p>Reacher is intrigued. There’s more to the story. The bad guys who jumped Rutherford are part of something serious and deadly, involving a conspiracy, a cover-up, and murder—all centered on a mousy little guy in a coffee-stained shirt who has no idea what he’s up against.</p> <p>Rule one: if you don’t know the trouble you’re in, keep Reacher by your side.</p>";
