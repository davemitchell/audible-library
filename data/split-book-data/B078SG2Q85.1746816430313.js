window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The \"master of heart-pounding suspense\" returns with a brand-new audiobook series - </b><b><i>The Third Victim</i></b><b> is </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best seller Phillip Margolin at his very best.</b> </p> <p>A woman stumbles onto a dark road in rural Oregon - tortured, battered, and bound. She tells a horrific story about being kidnapped, then tortured, until she finally managed to escape. She was the lucky one - two other women, with similar burns and bruises, were found dead. </p> <p>The surviving victim identifies the house where she was held captive, and the owner, Alex Mason - a prominent local attorney - is arrested. Although he loudly insists upon his innocence, his wife's statements about his sexual sadism and the physical evidence found at the scene, his summer home, is damning. </p> <p>Regina Barrister is a legendary criminal defense attorney, known as \"The Sorceress\" for her courtroom victories. But she's got a secret, one that threatens her skill, her reputation, and, most of all, her clients. And she's agreed to take on the seemingly impossible task of defending Alex Mason. </p> <p>Robin Lockwood, a young lawyer and former MMA fighter, has just left a clerkship at the Oregon Supreme Court to work for Regina Barrister. The Alex Mason trial is her first big one, a likely death penalty case, and she's second chair to Regina. Increasingly, she's worried her boss' behavior and the details in the case against their client don't quite add up.</p> <p><i>This program includes a bonus conversation with the author.</i></p>";
