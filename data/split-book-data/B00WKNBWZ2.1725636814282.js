It’s enough money to completely transform Rick’s life - and everything he thought he knew about his father.</p> <p>Yet the more of his father’s hidden past that Rick brings to light, the more dangerous his present becomes. Soon, he finds himself on the run from deadly enemies desperate to keep the past buried, and only solving the mystery of his father - a man who has been unable to communicate, comprehend, or care for himself for almost 20 years - will save Rick...if he can survive long enough to do it.</p>";
