window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Finn’s search for his memory of one fateful night leads him to Iceland—only to be followed by an unhinged assassin intent on stopping him—in the riveting follow-up to </b><b><i>Steel Fear,</i></b><b> from the </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling writing team Webb &amp; Mann, combat-decorated Navy SEAL Brandon Webb and award-winning author John David Mann.</b></p> <p><b>“One of the best crime novels of the year . . . a brilliant blend of procedural mystery and geopolitical thriller.”—Jeffery Deaver, </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author of </b><b><i>Hunting Time</i></b></p> <p>Disgraced Navy SEAL Finn is on the run. A wanted man since he jumped ship from the USS <i>Abraham Lincoln,</i> he’s sought for questioning in connection to war crimes committed in Yemen by a rogue element in his SEAL team. But his memory of that night—as well as the true fate of his mentor and only friend, Lieutenant Kennedy—is a gaping hole.</p> <p>Finn learns that three members of his team have been quietly redeployed to Iceland, which is a puzzle in itself; the tiny island nation is famous for being one of the most peaceful, crime-free places on the planet.</p> <p>His mission is simple: track down the three corrupt SEALs and find out what really happened that night in Yemen. But two problems stand in his way. On his first night in town a young woman mysteriously drowns—and a local detective suspects Finn’s involvement. What’s worse, a SEAL-turned-contract-killer with skills equal to Finn’s own has been hired to make sure he never gets the answers he’s looking for. And he’s followed Finn all the way to the icy north.</p>";
