window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>John Wells goes undercover in Saudi Arabia in a cutting-edge novel of modern suspense from the #1 <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author. </p> <p> John Wells may have left the CIA, but it hasn't left him. A mysterious call brings a surprise meeting with the aged monarch of Saudi Arabia, King Abdullah. \"My kingdom is on a precipice,\" he tells Wells. \"Powerful factions are plotting against me, and my own family is in danger. I don't know who I can trust, but I'm told I can trust you.\" </p> <p> Reluctantly, and with the secret blessing of the CIA, Wells goes undercover; but the more he learns, the more complicated things become, and soon he, too, is unsure whom to trust, in Saudi Arabia or Washington. One thing, however, is clear: If the conspirators prevail, it will mean more than the fall of a monarch-it may be the beginning of the final conflagration between America and Islam.</p>";
