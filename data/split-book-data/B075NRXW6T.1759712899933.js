The whiteness covers the courthouse, but it cannot conceal the memories at work inside: the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, an unrequited love, and the ghosts of racism that still haunt the islanders. First novels rarely attract as much attention as <i>Snow Falling on Cedars</i>. Remaining on best seller lists for months, it has cast a spell on listeners across the country. </p>";
