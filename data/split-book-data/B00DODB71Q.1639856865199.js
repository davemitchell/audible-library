window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>There are just 77 days to go before a deadly asteroid collides with Earth, and Detective Hank Palace is out of a job. With the Concord police force operating under the auspices of the U.S. Justice Department, Hank’s days of solving crimes are over - until a woman from his past begs for help finding her missing husband. </p> <p>Brett Cavatone disappeared without a trace - an easy feat in a world with no phones, no cars, and no way to tell whether someone’s gone \"bucket list\" or just gone. With society falling to shambles, Hank pieces together what few clues he can, on a search that leads him from a college-campus-turned-anarchist-encampment to a crumbling coastal landscape where anti-immigrant militia fend off \"impact zone\" refugees. </p> <p>The second novel in the Last Policeman trilogy, <i>Countdown City</i> presents a fascinating mystery set on the brink of an apocalypse - and once again, Hank Palace confronts questions way beyond \"whodunit.\" What do we as human beings owe to one another? And what does it mean to be civilized when civilization is collapsing all around you?</p>";
