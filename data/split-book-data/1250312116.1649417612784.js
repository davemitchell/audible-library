One terrifying side effect of the weapon is that prior to the devastation, the vibrations drive ordinary people to suicide and violence. A wave of madness begins sweeping the country beginning with a mass shooting in Congress.&nbsp;</p> <p>Joe Ledger and his team go on a wild hunt to stop the terrorists and uncover the global superpower secretly funding them. At every step, the stakes increase as it becomes clear the endgame of this campaign of terror is igniting the Yellowstone caldera, the supervolcano that could destroy America.&nbsp;</p>";
