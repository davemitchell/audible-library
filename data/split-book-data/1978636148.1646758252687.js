window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"<i>Primary Target</i> is a chilling scenario of global warfare. The suspense never stops.\"—W.E.B. Griffin</p> <p>“Weber weaves a frighteningly real story of international terrorism in America in his newest thriller.”—<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p> <p>As the once-powerful Soviet Union descends into social and economic collapse, a group of hard-line communists has devised a strategy to return their country to its former glory. In league with the most ruthless militant extremists of the Middle East, they hatch a plot to eliminate the one person with the power to stop them:&nbsp;the President of the United States.</p> <p>This time, America isn’t declaring a war against terrorism. The terrorists are declaring war on America....</p> <p>“Weber colors his novel with numerous subplots, well-developed characters and historical references to Operation Desert Storm and the Iranian hostage crisis. His knowledge of weapons, military aircraft and terrorist tactics is superior, and a surprise ending teases readers with the tempting possibility....”—<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p> <p>“Some writers get better with age: Weber is among them.”—<i>Library Journal</i></p>";
