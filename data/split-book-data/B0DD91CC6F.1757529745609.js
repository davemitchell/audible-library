Features an audio-exclusive foreword read by David Baldacci.</b></p> <p>Fourteen-year-old Charlie Matters is up to no good, but for a very good reason. Without parents, peerage, or merit, ducking school but barred from actual work, he steals what he needs, living day-to-day until he’s old enough to enlist to fight the Germans. After barely surviving the Blitz, Charlie knows there’s no telling when a falling bomb might end his life.</p> <p>Fifteen-year-old Molly Wakefield has just returned to a nearly unrecognizable London. One of millions of people to have been evacuated to the countryside via “Operation Pied Piper,” Molly has been away from her parents—from her home—for nearly five years. Her return, however, is not the homecoming she’d hoped for as she’s confronted by a devastating reality: neither of her parents are there, only her old nanny, Mrs. Pride.</p> <p>Without guardians and stability, Charlie and Molly find an unexpected ally and protector in Ignatius Oliver, and solace at his book shop, The Book Keep, where \"a book a day keeps the bombs away\". Mourning the recent loss of his wife, Ignatius forms a kinship with both children, and in each other—over the course of the greatest armed conflict the world had ever seen—they rediscover the spirit of family each has lost.</p> <p>But Charlie’s escapades in the city have not gone unnoticed, and someone’s been following Molly since she returned to London. And Ignatius is reeling from a secret Imogen long kept from him while she was alive—something so shocking it resulted in her death, and his life being turned upside down.</p> <p>As bombs continue to bear down on the city, Charlie, Molly, and Ignatius learn that while the perils of war rage on, their coming together and trusting one another may be the only way for them to survive.</p> <p>“<b>A group of acclaimed narrators delivers an absorbing performance of David Baldacci's new novel.</b> In 1944 London, well-born 15-year-old Molly, 14-year-old Charlie from London's East Side, and Ignatius Oliver, a bereaved bookshop owner, are flung together to forge a found family in the midst of war. While the writing suggests a young adult novel, the complex story will certainly engage adult listeners. Stewart Crank's Charlie shines as a plucky boy who finds joy wherever. Alexandra Boulton's Molly is a sweet-voiced mix of kindhearted and imperious. John Lee's somewhat theatrical delivery captures the mysterious Ignatius. Nicola F. Delgado, Matthew Lloyd Davies, and Joe Pitts perform remarkable cameos of the other characters. And Baldacci pulls everything together in his well-read delivery of an interesting author's note.” © Audiofile 2025, Portland, Maine</p>";
