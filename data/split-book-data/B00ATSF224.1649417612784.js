window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The basis for the movie <i>Parker,</i> starring Jason Stratham and Jennifer Lopez!</b> </p> <p>Between Parker's 1961 debut and his return in the late 1990s, the world of crime changed considerably. Now fake IDs and credit cards have to be purchased from specialists; increasingly sophisticated policing makes escape and evasion tougher; and, worst of all, money has gone digital - the days of cash-stuffed payroll trucks were long gone. </p> <p>But cash isn't everything, and now Parker's after a fortune in jewels. In <i>Flashfire,</i> Parker's in West Palm Beach, competing with a crew that has an unhealthy love of explosions. When things go sour, Parker finds himself shot and trapped - and forced to rely on a civilian to survive.</p>";
