The son of an African American cop and a Mexican American painter, August Snow is most at home in Detroit's Mexicantown neighborhood, where he grew up - the neighborhood he's now returned to and hopes to revitalize with his settlement money of $12 million. The trouble is August has old enemies with scores to settle. </p> <p>When an old acquaintance, finance magnate Eleanore Paget, hears August is back in town, she tries to hire him to investigate suspicious goings-on at her investment bank. August declines - detective work is no longer his beat. When Eleanore is found dead the next day of an apparent suicide, August doesn't buy it for a minute. His search for her killer will drag him into a rat's nest of Detroit's most dangerous criminals.</p>";
