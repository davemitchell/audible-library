window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A definitive book for any CEO - first time or otherwise - of a high-growth company. </p> <p>While big company CEOs are usually groomed for the job for years, startup CEOs aren't - and they're often young and relatively inexperienced in business in general. </p> <p>Author Matt Blumberg, a technology and marketing entrepreneur, knows this all too well. Back in 1999, he started a company called Return Path, which later became the driving force behind the creation of his blog, <i>OnlyOnce</i> - because \"you're only a first time CEO once.\" </p> <p>Now, more than a decade later, he's written <i>Startup CEO</i>. As the fifth in the StartUp Revolution series, this reliable resource is based on Blumberg's experience as a startup CEO and covers a number of issues he's faced over the dozen years he's been a CEO. </p> <p>Engaging and informative, this book is essential reading for any, and every, CEO.</p>";
