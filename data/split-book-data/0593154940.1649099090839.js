A young priest, Christopher Fairfax, arrives in a remote Exmoor village to conduct the funeral of his predecessor. The land around is strewn with ancient artifacts - coins, fragments of glass, human bones - which the old parson used to collect.

Over the course of the next six days, everything he believes - about himself, his faith, and the history of his world - will be tested to destruction.</p>";
