window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Audie Award, 2019: Literary Fiction and Classics</b></p> <p><b>Winner of AudioFile Earphones Award 2018</b></p> <p>This Audible Exclusive performance of <i>Bleak House</i> features a unique introduction written and narrated by Miriam Margolyes.&nbsp;</p> <p>Recognised as one of Dickens' most accomplished titles, <i>Bleak House</i> has impressed critics and audiences alike since it was first published in 1852. The novel boasts one of the most intelligent and engaging plots in all of English literature and is sure to engage the listener's imagination as it transports us back in time to the seedy, grimy and hazardous streets of Victorian London.&nbsp;</p> <p>This release is part of the Dickens Collection, an exclusive series of unmissable performances available throughout 2018.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>About the audiobook:</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>At the heart of <i>Bleak House</i> is the longstanding case of <i>Jarndyce v. Jarndyce</i> - a damning portrayal of the 19th century legal system. Dickens shines a light on the impact that overdrawn court proceedings could have on the lives of those involved, specifically through two of his protagonists, Richard Carstone and his beloved Ada Clare.&nbsp;</p> <p>Dickens' unassuming heroine, Esther Summerson, along with the equally benevolent owner of Bleak House, John Jarndyce, attempts to guide the young lovers, Richard and Ada, to live their lives unaffected by the court proceedings. But with the introduction of some typically Dickensian characters such as Grandfather Smallweed and Mr Tulkinghorn, trouble soon ensues for all who cross their paths.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>About the author: </b></p> <p>Having experienced the incarceration of his father, Charles Dickens had to abandon his studies at a young age and set to work in a factory so as to support himself. Despite his short-lived education, Dickens went on to write 15 novels, various articles, novellas and short stories. He lectured and led campaigns for children's rights and education and arguably became the ultimate self-made man. <i>Bleak House</i> offers unique insight into the mind-set of a middle-aged Charles Dickens and the exceptional way in which his artistic skill had grown and developed by then.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>About the narrator:</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>Miriam Margolyes is an award-winning stage and screen actress, best known for her roles in <i>The Age of Innocence</i>, <i>Little Dorrit</i>, <i>Sunshine</i>, <i>Cold Comfort Farm</i> and <i>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</i>. Her stage credits include <i>The Vagina Monologues</i>, <i>Romeo &amp; Juliet</i>, <i>The Threepenny Opera</i>, <i>The Canterbury Tales</i> and her own one-woman show, <i>Dickens' Woman</i>. Miriam has always been a keen admirer of Charles Dickens and demonstrates a profound understanding of his themes and writing style through her skilful narration of <i>Bleak House</i>.&nbsp;</p>";
