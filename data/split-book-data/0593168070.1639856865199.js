window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The number one</b> <b><i>New York Times</i></b><b>&nbsp;best-selling author of&nbsp;</b><b><i>World War Z</i></b><b>&nbsp;is back with “the Bigfoot thriller you didn’t know you needed in your life, and one of the greatest horror novels I’ve ever read” (Blake Crouch, author of&nbsp;</b><b><i>Dark Matter</i></b><b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</b><b><i>Recursion</i></b><b>).</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>As the ash and chaos from Mount Rainier’s eruption swirled and finally settled, the story of the Greenloop massacre has passed unnoticed, unexamined...until now. The journals of resident Kate Holland, recovered from the town’s bloody wreckage, capture a tale too harrowing - and too earth-shattering in its implications - to be forgotten. In this audiobook, Max Brooks brings Kate’s extraordinary account to light for the first time, faithfully reproducing her words alongside his own extensive investigations into the massacre and the legendary beasts behind it. Kate’s is a tale of unexpected strength and resilience, of humanity’s defiance in the face of a terrible predator’s gaze, and, inevitably, of savagery and death.</p> <p>Yet it is also far more than that.</p> <p>Because if what Kate Holland saw in those days is real, then we must accept the impossible. We must accept that the creature known as Bigfoot walks among us - and that it is a beast of terrible strength and ferocity.</p> <p>Part survival narrative, part bloody horror tale, part scientific journey into the boundaries between truth and fiction, this is a Bigfoot story as only Max Brooks could chronicle it - and like none you’ve ever heard before.</p> <p><b>Praise for&nbsp;</b><b><i>Devolution</i></b></p> <p>“Delightful...[A] tale of supernatural mayhem that fans of King and Crichton alike will enjoy.” (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>, starred review)&nbsp;</p> <p>“The story is told in such a compelling manner that horror fans will want to believe and, perhaps, take the warning to heart.” (<i>Booklist</i>, starred review)<br> &nbsp;</p> <p><b>The Cast:</b><br> Judy Greer as Kate Holland<br> Nathan Fillion as Frank McCray<br> Kimberly Guerrero as Josephine Schell&nbsp;</p> <p><b><i>With</i></b><br> Jeff Daniels as Steve Morgan<br> Mira Furlan as Mostar<br> Kate Mulgrew as Hannah Reinhardt-Roth<br> Steven Weber as Tony Durant<br> and<br> Terry Gross and Kai Ryssdal as themselves<br> and<br> Max Brooks as the researcher</p>";
