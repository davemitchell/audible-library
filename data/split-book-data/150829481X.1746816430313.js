He is our last hope. He is our only hope.</p> <p>On a lonely moor in northern England, the body of a young woman is discovered. In the south, a girl lies buried beneath a Saxon mound. To the southeast, the ruins of a priory hide a human skull. Each is a sacrifice, a summons. And something in the darkness has heard the call. </p> <p>Charlie Parker has also heard it, and from the forests of Maine to the deserts of the Mexican border, from the canals of Amsterdam to the streets of London, he will track those who would cast the world into darkness. Parker fears no evil - but evil fears him.</p> <p>“A seamless, expansive, and chilling blend of police procedural and gothic horror tale” (Kirkus Reviews), <i>A Book of Bones </i>will keep you guessing until the very last chapter.</p>";
