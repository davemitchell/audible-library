Keith’s father became a legendary prosecutor, determined to “clean up the Coast.” Hugh’s father became the “Boss” of Biloxi’s criminal underground. Keith went to law school and followed in his father’s footsteps. Hugh preferred the nightlife and worked in his father’s clubs. The two families were headed for a showdown—one that would ultimately happen in a courtroom.<br> <br> Life itself hangs in the balance in <i>The Boys from Biloxi, </i>a sweeping saga rich with history and with a large cast of unforgettable characters.</p>";
