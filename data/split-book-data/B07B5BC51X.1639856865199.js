window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From <i>USA Today</i> best-selling author Brett Battles comes the second book in a spin-off series from his award-winning Jonathan Quinn thrillers. </p> <p>Something's happening in the small town of Bradbury. Something more sinister than the disappearance of the woman the Excoms have been sent to find. Something only they can stop. </p> <p>Ananke, Rosario, Dylan, Liesel, and Ricky have reassembled to undertake their second mission. Seems easy enough: locate the missing woman and be on their way. But not even the mysterious Administrator who called them together could have predicted what the team would encounter. </p> <p>Inhumanity comes in many forms. The Excoms despise them all. </p>";
