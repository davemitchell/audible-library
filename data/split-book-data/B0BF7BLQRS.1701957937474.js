window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the award-winning author of </b><b><i>The Every</i></b><b> comes an endearing story of a dog who unwittingly becomes a hero to a park full of animals.</b></p> <p>Johannes, a free dog, lives in an urban park by the sea. His job is to be the Eyes—to see everything that happens within the park and report back to the park’s elders, three ancient Bison. His friends—a seagull, a raccoon, a squirrel, and a pelican—work with him as the Assistant Eyes, observing the humans and other animals who share the park and making sure the Equilibrium is in balance.&nbsp;</p> <p>But changes are afoot. More humans, including Trouble Travelers, arrive in the park. A new building, containing mysterious and hypnotic rectangles, goes up. And then there are the goats—an actual <i>boatload </i>of goats—who appear, along with a shocking revelation that changes Johannes’s view of the world.</p> <p>A story about friendship, beauty, liberation, and running very, <i>very </i>fast, <i>The Eyes &amp; the Impossible</i> will make listeners of all ages see the world around them in a wholly new way.</p>";
