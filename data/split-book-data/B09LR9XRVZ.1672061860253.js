A chosen one. And the inevitable quest to slay a villain, save the kingdom, and fulfill a grand destiny.&nbsp;</p> <p>But this is not that kind of story.&nbsp;</p> <p>It does begin with a prophecy: A child will rise to defeat the Eternal Khan, a cruel immortal god-king, and save the kingdom.&nbsp;</p> <p>And that prophecy did anoint a hero, Jian, raised since birth in luxury and splendor, and celebrated before he has won a single battle.&nbsp;</p> <p>But that’s when the story hits its first twist: The prophecy is wrong.&nbsp;</p> <p>What follows is a story more wondrous than any prophecy could foresee, and with many unexpected heroes: Taishi, an older woman who is the greatest grandmaster of magical martial arts in the kingdom but who thought her adventuring days were all behind her; Sali, a straitlaced warrior who learns the rules may no longer apply when the leader to whom she pledged her life is gone; and Qisami, a chaotic assassin who takes a little too much pleasure in the kill.</p> <p>And Jian himself, who has to find a way to become what he no longer believes he can be—a hero after all.</p>";
