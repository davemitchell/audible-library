window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Get to know the detective in charge of Copenhagen's coldest cases in the first electrifying Department Q mystery from <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author&nbsp;Jussi Adler-Olsen.</p> <p>Carl Mørck used to be one of Denmark’s best homicide detectives. Then a hail of bullets destroyed the lives of two fellow cops, and Carl - who didn’t draw his weapon - blames himself. So a promotion is the last thing he expects. But Department Q is a department of one, and Carl’s got only a stack of cold cases for company. His colleagues snicker, but Carl may have the last laugh, because one file keeps nagging at him: A liberal politician vanished five years earlier and is presumed dead. But she isn’t dead...yet.</p> <p>Darkly humorous, propulsive, and atmospheric, <i>The Keeper of Lost Causes</i> introduces American listeners to the mega-bestselling series fast becoming an international sensation.</p>";
