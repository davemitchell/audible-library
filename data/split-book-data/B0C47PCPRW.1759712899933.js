He doesn’t spend much time thinking about those days, at least not until a former teammate comes looking for him.</p> <p>The man is here to ask a favor. He wants Alex to help him find the woman with whom he had a brief, passionate affair three decades ago. Who is Alex to deny his friend a chance to ward off a classic midlife chill by rekindling an old flame? But as the search deepens, McKnight begins to suspect that he hasn’t been told the full story. And there might just be a reason why this mysterious woman is so hard to find.</p>";
