window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In 1956 a plane bearing mysterious cargo takes off from a small airport outside Los Angeles and disappears into a raging storm. Nearly 60 years later, while flying over the Sierra Nevada, retired military assassin turned civilian flight instructor and would-be Buddhist Cordell Logan catches a glint of sunlight on metal and spots what appears to be an aircraft wreckage. His life will never be the same. </p> <p>Logan and his beautiful ex-wife, Savannah, plan a reconciliation in posh Lake Tahoe. But upon landing in the <i>Ruptured Duck</i>, his beloved aging Cessna, Logan agrees to put those plans on hold when he's asked to help guide a search-and-rescue team to the remote, mountainous crash site. The team finds not only a long-missing airplane, with the mummified remains of its pilot still at the controls, but something much more recent and far more sinister: the body of a young man, shot to death only hours earlier. Someone has beaten the rescuers to the site and will clearly stop at nothing to profit from what the plane was carrying - including kidnapping and threatening to kill Savannah if Logan refuses to help them carry out their getaway plans. With the clock ticking and the love of his life in peril, Logan is drawn into a vexing vortex as personal and potentially deadly as any he's ever known. </p> <p><i>Voodoo Ridge</i> is a fast-paced, adrenaline-fueled thrill ride filled with the kind of unexpected twists, full-throttle action, and wry humor that won Freed's <i>Flat Spin</i> and <i>Fangs Out</i>, the first two installments in the Cordell Logan mystery series, rave reviews and a legion of loyal fans.</p>";
