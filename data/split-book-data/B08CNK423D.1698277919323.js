Now, to avenge the death of a close friend, he must wear his mask of deception once more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Beau Baxter was brutally murdered by a drugs cartel, but that doesn’t stop Milton from blaming himself for his friend’s death. With the help of a trusted team of undercover experts and Beau’s son, Milton is determined to track down the killers. And he isn't just after the man who gave the order.
