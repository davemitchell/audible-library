window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>#1 </b><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES </i></b><b>BESTSELLER • Don’t miss the hit streaming series </b><b><i>Reacher</i></b><b>! <br> <br> “</b><b><i>No Plan B</i></b><b> is not to be missed. A perfectly plotted, fast-paced thriller, with bigger twists than ever before. It’s no wonder Jack Reacher is everyone’s favorite rebel hero.”—Karin Slaughter</b><br> <br> <b>ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR: </b><b><i>Reader’s Digest</i></b><br> <br> In Gerrardsville, Colorado, a woman dies under the wheels of a moving bus. The death is ruled a suicide. But Jack Reacher saw what really happened: A man in a gray hoodie and jeans, moving stealthily, pushed the victim to her demise—before swiftly grabbing the dead woman’s purse and strolling away.<br> <br> When another homicide is ruled an accident, Reacher knows this is no coincidence. With a killer on the loose, Reacher has no time to waste to track down those responsible. <br> <br> But Reacher is unaware that these crimes are part of something much larger and more far-reaching: an arsonist out for revenge, a foster kid on the run, a cabal of powerful people involved in a secret conspiracy with many moving parts. There is no room for error, but they make a grave one. They don’t consider Reacher a threat. <i>“There’s too much at stake to start running from shadows.”</i> But Reacher isn’t a shadow. He is flesh and blood. And relentless when it comes to making things right.<br> <br> For when the threat is Reacher, there is <i>No Plan B.</i></p>";
