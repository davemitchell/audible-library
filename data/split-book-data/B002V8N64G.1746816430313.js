window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The series that started it all!</b></p> <p>In this powerful follow-up to his action-packed thriller <i>The Kill Clause</i>, Gregg Hurwitz, the new maestro of pulse-pounding suspense, ratchets up the excitement with another sensational pause resister featuring Tim Rackley, a driven lawman motivated by honor, morality, and a deep sense of justice.</p> <p>Called back into the fold of the US Marshals Service, Tim is tasked with retrieving Leah Henning, the daughter of a powerful Hollywood producer, from a mind-control cult. As Tim wends his way deep undercover into an insidious operation called The Program, he confronts a brand of mind-warping manipulation beyond his worst expectations.</p> <p>Tim becomes enmeshed with a diverse band of characters - from the charismatic, messianic leader T. D. Betters to a cult reject burnout to the intelligent yet highly vulnerable Leah herself - and finds himself caught in a shadowy landscape of lies, manipulation, and terror. At stake: innocent minds - maybe even his own.</p>";
