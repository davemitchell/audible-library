When a powerful Russian mob family declares war by publicly executing two high-profile American politicians, the message is unmistakable - opposition will be met with overwhelming deadly force. With no other viable options, the President creates a clandestine assassinations team to find and eliminate the unreachable men running this deadly criminal operation.</p> <p>The CIA recruits two Tier 1 operators - former Navy SEALs Billy Cosgrove and Rob Tacoma. But before they can even get started, the Russians act - murdering Cosgrove in his own home. Now Tacoma is on his own against an organization with endless resources and no boundaries. Step one requires the near impossible - find and kill the hidden mob boss behind Cosgrove’s death. To do this, he’ll have to take on an army in a battle where there are no rules and no limits.</p>";
