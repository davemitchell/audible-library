window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A newbie Seattle detective gets an education in corruption in a short story that explores Detective Castigliano’s origins in the Seattle PD by Robert Dugoni, the Amazon Charts and </b><b><i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><b> bestselling author of the Tracy Crosswhite series.</b></p> <p>His old life in the rearview, Del Castigliano has left Wisconsin to work homicide for the Seattle PD. Breaking him in is veteran detective Moss Gunderson, and he’s handing Del a big catch: the bodies of two unidentified men fished from Lake Union. It’s a major opportunity for the new detective, and Del runs with it, chasing every lead - to every dead end. Despite the help of another section rookie, Vic Fazzio, Del is going nowhere fast. Until one shotgun theory looks to be dead right: the victims are casualties of a drug smuggling operation. But critical information is missing - or purposely hidden. It’s forcing Del into a crisis of character and duty that not even the people he trusts can help him resolve.</p>";
