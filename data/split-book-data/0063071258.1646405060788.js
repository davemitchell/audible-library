They are...the 10th justice.</p> <p>Landing a prestigious position as a Supreme Court clerk fresh out of Yale Law, Ben Addison is on the ultrafast track to success - until he inadvertently shares a classified secret with the wrong listener. And now the anonymous blackmailer who made a killing with Ben’s information is demanding more.&nbsp;</p> <p>Guilty of a criminal act, his golden future suddenly in jeopardy, Ben turns for help to his roommates - three close friends from childhood, each strategically placed near the seats of Washington power - and to his beautiful, whip-smart fellow clerk, Lisa Schulman. But trust is a dangerous commodity in the nation’s capital. And when lives, careers, and power are at stake, loyalties can shatter like glass...and betrayals can be lethal.</p>";
