window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From <i>USA Today</i> best-selling author Brett Battles comes another exciting adventure in his award winning Jonathan Quinn thriller series.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Jonathan Quinn is the best at what he does: making bodies disappear. Within the espionage world, his reputation is impeccable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>There was a time, though, when that reputation was still being built under his mentor, Durrie. A time when the very man who had taught Quinn all he knew could have derailed the young cleaner’s future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Fifteen years ago, Quinn was offered a job. On the surface, a straightforward mission to stop a terrorist. But the client gave Quinn the additional task of taking on Durrie as his number two, as a last chance for the veteran agent to be rehabilitated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Durrie had been on a downward spiral, going from being a highly respected operative to an unreliable has-been. These changes threatened to destroy everything - not only in Quinn’s life, but Orlando’s, too. She was Durrie’s girlfriend, and Quinn’s best friend.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Both she and Quinn were desperate to help Durrie return to the person he once was. They hoped this job would be the answer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Durrie had other plans.</p>";
