The last thing the White House can afford is a new war in the Mideast that could derail the treaty and set the region ablaze. U.S. and Israeli forces are mobilizing to find the hostages and get them home, but Ryker knows the clock is ticking.&nbsp;</p> <p>When Hezbollah realizes who they’ve captured, no amount of ransom will save them - they’ll be transferred to Beirut and then to Tehran to be executed on live television.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the fourth installment of Rosenberg’s gripping series, Marcus Ryker finds himself in the most dangerous situation he has ever faced - captured, brutalized, and dragged deep behind enemy lines.&nbsp;</p> <p>Should he wait to be rescued?
