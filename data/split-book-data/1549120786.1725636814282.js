Now that mentor, John Jack Thompson, is dead, but after his funeral his widow hands Bosch a murder book that Thompson took with him when he left the LAPD 20 years before - the unsolved killing of a troubled young man in an alley used for drug deals.</p> <p>Bosch brings the murder book to Renée Ballard and asks her to help him find what about the case lit Thompson's fire all those years ago. As she begins her inquiries - while still working her own cases on the midnight shift - Ballad finds aspects of the initial investigation that just don't add up. </p> <p>The bond between Bosch and Ballard tightens as they become a formidable investigation team. And they soon arrive at a disturbing question: Did Thompson steal the murder book to work the case in retirement, or to make sure it never got solved? </p> <p>Written with the intense pacing and masterful suspense that have made Michael Connelly \"the hard-boiled fiction master of our time\" (NPR), <i>The Night Fire</i> continues the unofficial partnership of two fierce detectives determined not to let the fire burn out. </p>";
