window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle </i>is a tour de force - and one of Haruki Murakami’s most acclaimed and beloved novels.</p> <p>In a Tokyo suburb, a young man named Toru Okada searches for his wife’s missing cat - and then for his wife as well - in a netherworld beneath the city’s placid surface. As these searches intersect, he encounters a bizarre group of allies and antagonists.&nbsp;</p> <p>Gripping, prophetic, and suffused with comedy and menace, this is an astonishingly imaginative detective story, an account of a disintegrating marriage, and an excavation of the buried secrets from Japan’s forgotten campaign in Manchuria during World War II.&nbsp;</p>";
