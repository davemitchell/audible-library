window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>As a fledgling reporter, Fletch is doing more flailing than anything else. That and floating around from department to department trying to figure out where he fits. His managing editor's got him pegged for the society pages, but the kind of society Fletch gets involved with is anything but polite.</p> <p>His first big interview, a millionaire lawyer with a crooked streak and an itch to give away some of his ill-gotten gains, ends up dead in the <i>News-Tribune</i>'s parking lot before Fletch can ask question number one. So Fletch goes after the murderer instead and ends up learning a thing or two about crime and punishment.</p> <p>At the same time, he's supposed to be covering (or maybe uncovering) a health spa that caters to all its clients' needs and gets hired as a <i>very </i>personal trainer. Never mind that he's supposed to be getting married at the end of the week; Fletch has a few other engagements to take care of first.</p>";
