Six movie-theater employees were killed in an armed robbery while one inexplicably survived. Then, a teenage girl vanished from the annual state fair. Neither crime was ever solved.</p> <p>Twenty-five years later, the reverberations of those unsolved cases quietly echo through survivors’ lives. A private investigator in Vegas, Wyatt’s latest inquiry takes him back to a past he’s tried to escape - and drags him deeper into the harrowing mystery of the movie house robbery that left six of his friends dead.</p> <p>Like Wyatt, Julianna struggles with the past - with the day her beautiful older sister, Genevieve, disappeared. When Julianna discovers that one of the original suspects has resurfaced, she’ll stop at nothing to find answers.</p> <p>As Wyatt's case becomes more complicated and dangerous, and Julianna seeks answers from a ghost, their obsessive quests not only stir memories of youth and first love but also begin to illuminate dark secrets of the past. But will their shared passion and obsession heal them or push them closer to the edge? Even if they find the truth, will it help them understand what happened that long and faraway gone summer? Will it set them free - or ultimately destroy them?</p>";
