window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The author of <i>The Eternal World</i> seamlessly combines history, biotechnology, action, and adventure in this high-concept thriller in the spirit of James Rollins, Brad Thor, and Douglas Preston. </p> <p>John Smith has a special gift that seems more like a curse: He can access other people's thoughts. He hears the songs stuck in their heads, their most private traumas and fears, the painful memories they can't let go. The CIA honed his skills until he was one of their most powerful operatives, but Smith fled the agency and now works as a private consultant, trying to keep the dark potential of his gift in check - and himself out of trouble. </p> <p>But now Smith is unexpectedly plunged into dangerous waters when his latest client, billionaire software genius Everett Sloan, hires him to investigate a former employee - a tech whiz kid named Eli Preston - and search his thoughts for some very valuable intellectual property he's stolen. Before John can probe Preston's mind, his identity is compromised, and he's on a run for his life with Sloan's young associate, Kelsey. </p> <p>Hunted by shadowy enemies with deep resources and unknown motives, John and Kelsey must go off the grid. John knows their only hope for survival is using his powers to their fullest - even if means putting his own sanity at risk. </p>";
