window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From decorated Green Beret sniper, UFC headliner, and all around badass, Tim Kennedy, a rollicking, inspirational </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling memoir offering lessons in how to embrace failure and weather storms, in order to unlock the strongest version of yourself.</b><br> <br> Tim Kennedy has a problem; he only feels alive right before he’s about to die. Kennedy, a Green Beret, decorated Army sniper, and UFC headliner, has tackled a bull with his bare hands, jumped out of airplanes, dove to the depths of the ocean, and traveled the world hunting poachers, human traffickers, and the Taliban.<br> <br> But he’s also the same man who got kicked out of the police department, fire department, and as an EMT, before getting two women pregnant four days apart, and finally, been beaten up by his Special Forces colleagues for, quite simply, “being a selfish asshole.”<br> <br> With his vivid and stirring voice, <i>Scars and Stripes</i> “is an authentic gut punch of a life lived with grit, resiliency, and a never-quit attitude in the face of heartbreaking failures and incredible success that every American can learn from” (Patrick Murphy, veteran and former United States Under Secretary of the Army). Kennedy reveals that failure isn’t the end—rather it’s the first step towards unearthing the best version of yourself and finding success, no matter how overwhelming the setbacks may feel.</p>";
