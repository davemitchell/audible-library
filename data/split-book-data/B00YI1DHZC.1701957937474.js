window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When Toby Haynes witnesses a double murder - and suspects his boss, Tanner Mason, as the perpetrator of the crime - he does the only thing he can think of: He calls in Nathan McBride. CIA special ops veteran McBride and his partner, Harvey Fontana, respond to their friend's plea. As they launch a covert investigation into Mason, the security chief for one of the nation's leading private military contractors, they discover that not everything is as it appears. </p> <p>Mason and his inner circle are leading a top-secret operation to tackle a wave of crime plaguing the US-Mexican border, and the murder may have been part of their complicated strategy - or part of a more menacing agenda. Soon McBride and Fontana find themselves engaged in a deadly game. With a powerful politician behind it all, stopping Mason could mean joining a secret war - with truly global stakes. </p>";
