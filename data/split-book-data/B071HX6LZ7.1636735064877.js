President Susan Hopkins, running for re-election, is floored as she watches the returns come in. Her rival, a madman senator from Alabama who ran on the promise to deport all Chinese and to nuke China's ships out of the South China Sea, has, inconceivably, won. </p> <p>President Hopkins, though, knows she cannot yield power. To do so would be to spark World War Three. </p> <p>Knowing the election was stolen, President Hopkins needs 48 hours to prove it, and to stop the escalating war games with the Chinese. With no one left to turn to, she summons Luke Stone, the former head of an elite FBI para-military team. The stakes could not be higher as she commands him to save America from its greatest threat: its own president-elect. </p> <p>Yet as one shocking twist follows another, it may, even for Luke Stone, be too late. </p> <p>A political thriller with non-stop action, dramatic international settings and heart-pounding suspense, <i>President Elect</i> is book five in the best-selling and critically-acclaimed Luke Stone series, an explosive new series that will leave you listening late into the night. </p>";
