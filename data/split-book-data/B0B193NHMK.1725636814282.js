Job.</b></p> <p><b><i>USA Today and</i></b><b> Amazon two-million copy best-selling author Blake Banner is back with a brand-new gripping thriller series!</b></p> <p>One thing Harry Bauer knew for certain: He was not a man who could ever fall in love and make a home. Until it happened. And then he knew something else. He had to give up his job as an assassin for Cobra. He could not lie to that woman; he could not bring danger into her life. But then a hit squad came after him, and Cobra made him an offer he could not refuse. One last job, the Einstaat Brief, and they would keep her safe.<br> <br> One last job: A job that would take him to Andorra, high in the Pyrenees, to a secret conference of 130 of the world’s most powerful men and women, cloistered in a luxury hotel to discuss the future of the world. Among them, Stephen Plant, Andrew Ashkenazi, and William Hughes--IT billionaires, believers in \"strong Ai\". Each one of them must die. Because their plans for humanity cannot be allowed to succeed.<br> <br> There was just one problem. It had to be done then, right then, with no planning and no intel. And only Harry Bauer could do that….</p>";
