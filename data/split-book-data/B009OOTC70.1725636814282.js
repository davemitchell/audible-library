window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A big, panoramic story of the new America, as told by our master chronicler of the way we live now. </p> <p>As a police launch speeds across Miami's Biscayne Bay - with officer Nestor Camacho on board - Tom Wolfe is off and running. Into the feverous landscape of the city, he introduces the Cuban mayor; the black police chief; a wanna-go-muckraking young journalist and his Yale-marinated editor; an Anglo sex-addiction psychiatrist and his Latina nurse by day, loin lock by night - until lately, the love of Nestor's life; a refined, and oh-so-light-skinned young woman from Haiti and her Creole-spouting, black-gang-banger-stylin' little brother; a billionaire porn addict; crack dealers in the 'hoods; \"de-skilled\" conceptual artists at the Miami Art Basel Fair; \"spectators\" at the annual Biscayne Bay regatta looking only for that night's orgy; yenta-heavy ex-New Yorkers at an \"Active Adult\" condo; and a nest of shady Russians. </p> <p>Based on the same sort of detailed, on-scene, high-energy reporting that powered Tom Wolfe's previous best-selling novels, <i>Back to Blood</i> is another brilliant, spot-on, scrupulous, and often hilarious reckoning with our times.</p>";
