window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>David Rivers is used to his targets being chosen by the CIA. But this time, the target has chosen him.</p> <p>When a senator’s daughter is kidnapped in Benghazi, a Filipino terrorist named Khalil Noureddin claims responsibility and demands to negotiate with only one man: the leader of a CIA team that tried and failed to kill him over a year ago.</p> <p>David remembers the failure all too clearly. And while his team narrowly escaped a ruthless terrorist force, the attempt catapulted Khalil into international notoriety and caused him to vanish completely—until now.</p> <p>With David surrendering himself to Khalil to facilitate hostage negotiations, and his team embarking on a harrowing infiltration across Libya to support the rescue effort, the clock is ticking with an innocent woman’s life hanging in the balance.</p> <p>But capturing a high-profile hostage is just one element of Khalil’s plan.</p> <p>To uncover a far more insidious plot unfolding in Libya, David’s team will have to negotiate brutal militias, Russian mercenaries, and operatives of a mysterious terrorist syndicate…before it’s too late.</p>";
