window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Private investigator Cormoran Strike must track down a missing writer - and a sinister killer bent on destruction - in this \"wonderfully entertaining\" mystery (Harlan Coben, <i>New York Times Book Review</i>) that inspired the acclaimed HBO Max series&nbsp;<i>C.B. Strike</i>.</p> <p>When novelist Owen Quine goes missing, his wife calls in private detective Cormoran Strike. At first, Mrs. Quine just thinks her husband has gone off by himself for a few days - as he has done before - and she wants Strike to find him and bring him home.&nbsp;But as Strike investigates, he discovers that Quine's disappearance is no coincidence. The novelist has just completed a manuscript featuring poisonous pen-portraits of almost everyone he knows. If the novel were published, it would ruin lives - meaning that almost everyone in his life would have motives to silence him.&nbsp;When Quine is found brutally murdered under bizarre circumstances, Strike must race against time to understand the motivation of a ruthless killer, a killer unlike any he has encountered before...</p> <p>A compulsively readable crime novel with twists at every turn, <i>The Silkworm</i> is the second in J. K. Rowling's highly acclaimed series featuring Cormoran Strike and his determined young assistant, Robin Ellacott.</p>";
