window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From three design partners at Google Ventures, a unique five-day process for going from problem to prototype. </p> <p>The companies that Google Ventures invest in face big questions every day: Where's the most important place to focus your effort, and how do you start? What will your ideas look like in real life? How many meetings and discussions does it take before you can be sure you have the right solution to a problem? Business owners and investors want their companies and the people who lead them to be equipped to answer these questions - and quickly. And now there's a surefire way to solve their problems and test solutions: the sprint. </p> <p>While working at Google, designer Jake Knapp created a unique problem-solving method that he coined a \"design sprint\" - a five-day process to help companies answer crucial questions. His \"sprints\" were used in the development of everything from Gmail to Google X to Chrome. When he moved to Google Ventures, he joined Braden Kowitz and John Zeratsky, both designers and partners there who have worked on numerous products, including the YouTube redesign. Together Knapp, Zeratsky, and Kowitz have run over 100 sprints with their portfolio companies, inside Google, and in others companies or environments that have sought their help. They've seen firsthand how sprints can overcome challenges in all kinds of companies: health care, fitness, finance, retailers, and more. </p> <p>A practical guide to answering business questions, <i>Sprint</i> is a book for groups of any size, from small start-ups to Fortune 100s, from teachers and PTAs to nonprofits and public institutions. It's for anyone with a big opportunity, problem, or idea who needs to get answers today. </p>";
