window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>USA Today </i></b><b>best-selling author Ward Larsen's globe-trotting assassin, David Slaton, returns for another breathless adventure in </b><b><i>Assassin's Edge</i></b><b>!&nbsp;</b></p> <p>A US spy plane crashes off the northern coast of Russia at the same time that a Mossad operative is abducted from a street in Kazakhstan. The two events seem unrelated, but as suspicions rise, the CIA calls in its premier operative, David Slaton.&nbsp;</p> <p>When wreckage from the aircraft is discovered on a remote Arctic island, Slaton and a team are sent on a clandestine mission to investigate. While they comb a frigid Russian island at the top of the world, disaster strikes yet again: a US Navy destroyer sinks in the Black Sea.&nbsp;</p> <p>Evidence begins mounting that these disparate events are linked, controlled by an unseen hand. A mysterious source, code name Lazarus, provides tantalizing clues about another impending strike. Yet Lazarus has an agenda that is deeply personal, a thirst for revenge against a handful of clandestine operators. Prime among them: David Slaton.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>A Macmillan Audio production from Forge Books</b></p>";
