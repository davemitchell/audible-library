window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The extraordinary new Lucas Davenport thriller from number-one <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author and Pulitzer Prize winner John Sandford.</b> </p> <p>After the events in <i>Gathering Prey</i>, Lucas Davenport finds himself in a very unusual situation - no longer employed by the Minnesota BCA. His friend, the governor, is just cranking up a presidential campaign, though, and he invites Lucas to come along as part of his campaign staff. \"Should be fun!\" he says, and it kind of is - until they find they have a shadow: an armed man intent on killing the governor...and anyone who gets in the way. </p>";
