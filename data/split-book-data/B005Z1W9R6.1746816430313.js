window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In <i>The Killer Inside Me</i>, America's \"Dimestore Dostoevsky\" Jim Thompson goes where few novelists have dared to go, giving us a pitch-black glimpse into the mind of the American serial killer years before Charles Manson and Brett Easton Ellis's <i>American Psycho</i>, in the novel that will forever be known as the master performance of one of the greatest crime novelists of all time.</p> <p>Everyone in the small town of Central City, Texas loves Lou Ford. A deputy sheriff, Lou's known to the small-time criminals, the real-estate entrepreneurs, and all of his coworkers - the low-lifes, the big-timers, and everyone in-between - as the nicest guy around. He may not be the brightest or the most interesting man in town, but nevertheless, he's the kind of officer you're happy to have keeping your streets safe. The sort of man you might even wish your daughter would end up with someday.</p> <p>But behind the platitudes and glad-handing lurks a monster the likes of which few have seen. An urge that has already claimed multiple lives, and cost Lou his brother Mike, a self-sacrificing construction worker fell to his death on the job in what was anything but an accident. A murder that Lou is determined to avenge - and if innocent people have to die in the process, well, that's perfectly all right with him.</p>";
