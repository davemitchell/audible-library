window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"The story races at a dizzying pace.... [Woods] does show a reader a good time.\" (<i>Washington Post Book World</i>) </p> <p>Step One: The Perfect Murder </p> <p>Sandy Kinsolving's once-glittering life hangs by a thread; his future depends on his wife's inheritance and whether or not she's about to throw him out on his ear. What he wouldn't give for a solution to his money and marriage problems. </p> <p>If this were an Alfred Hitchcock movie, the solution would be obvious. Enter a stranger with wife problems of his own, who offers a violent - and mutually advantageous - proposal. </p> <p>Then, in the time it takes to whisper a word, Kinsolving's normal life ends. What radiate like a mirage before him are wealth, security, and freedom. But lurking in the shadows are a brutal murder he cannot prevent and a madman who stalks his every waking moment. </p> <p>\"One of the smoothest writers in the pop literature biz and always a pleasure to read.\" (<i>Detroit News</i>) </p>";
