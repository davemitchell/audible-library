He shows up in a new high school in a new town under a new name, makes a few friends, and doesn't stay long. Just long enough for someone to die - of \"natural causes\". </p> <p>Mission accomplished; Boy Nobody disappears, moving on to the next target. But when The Program assigns him to the mayor of New York City, things change. Somewhere deep inside, Boy Nobody is somebody: the kid he once was; the teen who wants normal things, like a real home and a girlfriend; a young man who wants out. And who just might want those things badly enough to sabotage The Program's mission.</p> <p>In this action-packed series debut, author Allen Zadoff pens a pause-resisting thriller that is as thought-provoking as it is gripping, introducing an utterly original and unforgettable antihero.</p>";
