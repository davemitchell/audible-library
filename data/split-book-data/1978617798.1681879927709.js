With his miraculous invention, an “echo box” that excavates sounds from the past, Eddie achieved the only thing he wanted: to hear his late mother sing. But where Eddie sees good, others see infamy. Because no conversation ever held will be a secret again.&nbsp;</p> <p>For Bob Stenson, leader of the American Heritage Foundation, whoever controls the echo box controls the future. To seize the game-changing device, he has to get Eddie where he’s most vulnerable: by kidnapping Dr. Skylar Drummond, the only person in the world Eddie trusts.&nbsp;</p> <p>But Stenson has underestimated his prey. Eddie has the power of echoes on his side. Now he must follow them - into the most dangerous places he’s ever ventured - to save Skylar and the country.</p>";
