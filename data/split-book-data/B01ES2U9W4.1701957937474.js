window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Cameron Tan wouldn't have even been in Greece if he hadn't gotten a 'D' in Art History. Instead of spending the summer after college completing his training as a Prophus operative, he's doing a study abroad program in Greece, enjoying a normal life - spending time with friends and getting teased about his crush on a classmate. Then the emergency notification comes in: a Prophus agent with vital information needs immediate extraction, and Cameron is the only agent on the ground, responsible for getting the other agent and data out of the country. </p> <p>The Prophus are relying on him to uncomplicate things. Easy. Easy, except the rival Genjix have declared all-out war against the Prophus, which means Greece is about to be a very dangerous place. And the agent isn't the only person relying on Cameron to get them safely out of the country - his friends from the study abroad program are, too. </p> <p>Cameron knows a good agent would leave them to fend for themselves. He also knows a good person wouldn't. Suddenly, things aren't easy at all. </p> <p><i>The Days of Tao</i> is the latest in the popular Tao series from award-winning author, Wesley Chu. Following after <i>The Rebirths of Tao</i>, this novella carries on the fast-moving and fun tone of the series. </p>";
