window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Dewey Andreas, former Delta and current intelligence agent, is sidelined. Still drowning in grief after the tragic murder of his fiancee, Dewey has seemingly lost his focus, his edge, and the confidence of his superiors. A high-level Russian hacker, known only as Cloud, is believed to be behind a series of major terror operations, and the mission is to capture and render Cloud harmless. At the same time, a backup team is sent after the only known associate of Cloud, a ballerina believed to be his girlfriend. Unwilling to sit out the mission as ordered, Dewey defies his superiors and goes rogue, surreptitiously following and tracking the two teams. What should be a pair of simple snatch-and-grab operations goes horribly wrong - both teams are ambushed and wiped out. Only through the unexpected intervention of Dewey is the backup operation salvaged. Cloud's girlfriend reveals a shocking secret - a plot so audacious and deadly that the masterminds behind it would risk anything and kill anybody to prevent its exposure. It's a plot that, in less than three days, will completely remake the world's political landscape and put at risk every single person in the Western world. On the run, with no backup and with only three days left, Dewey Andreas must unravel and stop this plot or see everything destroyed. A plot that goes live on July Fourth - Independence Day. </p>";
