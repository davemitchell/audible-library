That makes him curious. He wants to know, who dresses a murder victim up as a tramp, then leaves them in full view in a dumpster? But the answers he gets are not the ones he expects, and before long their investigation leads Stone and Dehan to St. Mary’s Roman Catholic Church and the darkest recesses of the human soul.</p> <p>It also leads them to some of the most powerful men in New York. Some, like Conor Hagan, head of the Irish Mob, are known criminals. But others are not.... Stone’s problem is deciding which of them are just criminals and which are truly evil. That is until ghosts start appearing from Dehan’s past.</p> <p>Then things get complicated....</p>";
