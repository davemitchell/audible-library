window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An aircraft carrier adrift with a crew the size of a small town. A killer in their midst. And the disgraced Navy SEAL who must track him down . . . The high-octane debut thriller from </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling writing team Webb &amp; Mann—combat-decorated Navy SEAL Brandon Webb and award-winning author John David Mann.</b></p> <p><b>A BARRY AWARD NOMINEE</b> • <b>“Sensationally good—an instant classic, maybe an instant legend.”—Lee Child</b></p> <p>The moment Navy SEAL sniper Finn sets foot on the USS <i>Abraham Lincoln</i>to hitch a ride home from the Persian Gulf, it’s clear something is deeply wrong. Leadership is weak. Morale is low. And when crew members start disappearing one by one, what at first seems like a random string of suicides soon reveals something far more sinister: There’s a serial killer on board. Suspicion falls on Finn, the newcomer to the ship. After all, he’s being sent home in disgrace, recalled from the field under the dark cloud of a mission gone horribly wrong. He’s also a lone wolf, haunted by gaps in his memory and the elusive sense that something he missed may have contributed to civilian deaths on his last assignment. Finding the killer offers a chance at redemption . . . if he can stay alive long enough to prove it isn’t him.</p> <p><b>NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY </b><b><i>PUBLISHERS WEEKLY</i></b></p>";
