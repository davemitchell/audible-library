window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Brett Battles delivers another suspense masterpiece in one of the year's most riveting international espionage thrillers.</p> <p>The world thought Dmitri Melnikov was dead.</p> <p>Especially Quinn. Why would he have believed otherwise, since the bomb intended for Melnikov had nearly killed Quinn and several members of his team?</p> <p>But Melnikov is not dead. He has been taken by someone who wants to shut him up. And the former chess champion isn’t the only one who has been abducted.</p> <p>US Intelligence can’t do anything about it. Not officially, anyway. The risk of causing an international incident is too great. What the agencies can do is ask someone who’d been there when Melnikov was kidnapped to do something for them.</p> <p>It’s not a normal mission for Quinn and his friends, and the chances they’ll all survive are slim, but this one is personal. So how can they say no?</p> <p>If you enjoy action-packed international espionage crime thrillers with high-stakes suspense, surprising plot-twists, and a cast full of unforgettable characters, then join millions of fans who love Battles’ novels and start devouring your next great listen <i>The Taken</i> now!</p>";
