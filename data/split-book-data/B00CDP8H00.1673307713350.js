He's got a year's supply of food, air, water, and no communication back to Earth, and must complete his 12 months' duty or his wife and son will have an \"accident\". </p> <p>But when someone all too familiar docks on the satellite, informs Hardie he's sitting in a veritable zero-G vault containing the world's most dangerous secrets, and forces a crash landing in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, Hardie must decide whether he's come face-to-face with the partner he needs to save his family - or with his nemesis.
