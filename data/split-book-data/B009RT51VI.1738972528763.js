Mulray believes he has discovered a drug that could prevent a previously incurable disease. It could be the salvation of millions of people and earn him billions of dollars. But the drug needs to be tested on human subjects, and Mulray needs more than blood samples - he needs autopsy results. </p> <p>When DeMarco is asked to look into the murder conviction of a lobbyist, he has other worries on his mind: His boss is no longer Speaker, his girlfriend has left him, and his friend Emma may be dying.
