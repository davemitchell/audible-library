With millions of dollars at stake, a number of groups step forward to claim her, including Danny's family, the tribe, and the federal government. </p> <p>As Wyoming's acting deputy attorney and a cadre of FBI officers descend on the town, Walt is determined to find out who would benefit from Danny's death, enlisting old friends Lucian Connolly and Omar Rhoades - along with Dog and best friend Henry Standing Bear - to trawl the vast Lone Elk ranch, looking for answers to a 65-million-year-old cold case that's heating up fast. </p>";
