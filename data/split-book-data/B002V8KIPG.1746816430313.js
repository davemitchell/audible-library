When the police can find no suspect or motive, the family of one of the victims seeks the services of the enigmatic and solitary specialist Roy Prescott, known for his ability to find people who don't want to be found. <p>Working outside the law and willing to do what the police can't, Prescott hunts the killer, an elusive adversary who is as smart, as methodical, as deadly as he is. The only way to conduct this pursuit is to goad the killer into believing that he must killï¿½Roy Prescott. It's a contest fought from one end of the country to the other, and both men understand that, when it's over, only one of them will be left alive.</p>";
