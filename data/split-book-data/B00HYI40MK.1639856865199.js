window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>John Wells goes undercover as the threat of nuclear war skyrockets between the United States and Iran, in the cutting-edge new novel from the number-one <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author. </p> <p>In an Istanbul hotel, a deep source warns a CIA agent that Iran intends to kill a CIA station chief. Quickly, John Wells is called in to investigate, but before he can get far, the tip comes true. Which means that the next warning the source gives will be taken very seriously indeed. And it's a big one. We've put a package on a ship from Dubai to the United States. A radioactive one. A bomb? Not yet. It's a test run. </p> <p>As the threat level jumps and the government mobilizes, something still doesnâ€™t smell right to Wells' old CIA boss Ellis Shafer, and so he sends Wells on a private mission to find out what's going on. But the two of them are swimming against the tide. From Guatemala to Thailand to Hong Kong to Istanbul, Wells uses every skill he has, including his ability to go undercover in the Arab world, to chase down leads. But it might not be enough. Soon there might be nothing anyone can do to pull the United States back from the brink of war.</p>";
