window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Earphones Award Winner (<i>AudioFile Magazine</i>) </b></p> <p>Anderson Lake is a company man, AgriGen's Calorie Man in Thailand. Under cover as a factory manager, Anderson combs Bangkok's street markets in search of foodstuffs thought to be extinct, hoping to reap the bounty of history's lost calories. </p> <p>There, he encounters Emiko...Emiko is the Windup Girl, a strange and beautiful creature. One of the New People, Emiko is not human; instead, she is an engineered being, creche-grown and programmed to satisfy the decadent whims of a Kyoto businessman, but now abandoned to the streets of Bangkok. Regarded as soulless beings by some, devils by others, New People are slaves, soldiers, and toys of the rich in a chilling near future in which calorie companies rule the world, the oil age has passed, and the side effects of bio-engineered plagues run rampant across the globe. </p> <p>What happens when calories become currency? What happens when bio-terrorism becomes a tool for corporate profits, when said bio-terrorism's genetic drift forces mankind to the cusp of post-human evolution? In <i>The Windup Girl</i>, award-winning author Paolo Bacigalupi returns to the world of <i>The Calorie Man</i> (Theodore Sturgeon Memorial Award-winner, Hugo Award nominee, 2006) and <i>Yellow Card Man</i> (Hugo Award nominee, 2007) in order to address these poignant questions. </p> <p><b>BONUS AUDIO:</b> In an exclusive introduction, author Paolo Bacigalupi explains how a horrible trip to Thailand led to the idea for <i>The Windup Girl.</i> </p>";
