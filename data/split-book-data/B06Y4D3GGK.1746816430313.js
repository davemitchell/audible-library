window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of <i>The Black Widow</i> comes the thrilling new summer blockbuster featuring legendary spy, assassin and art restorer Gabriel Allon.</b> </p> <p><b>A heart-stopping tale of suspense, Daniel Silva's runaway best seller <i>The Black Widow</i> was one of 2016's biggest novels. Now, in <i>House of Spies</i>, Gabriel Allon is back and out for revenge - determined to hunt down the world's most dangerous terrorist, a shadowy ISIS mastermind known only as Saladin.</b> </p> <p>Four months after the deadliest attack on the American homeland since 9/11, terrorists leave a trail of carnage through London's glittering West End. The attack is a brilliant feat of planning and secrecy, but with one loose thread. </p> <p>The thread leads Gabriel Allon and his team of operatives to the south of France and to the gilded doorstep of Jean-Luc Martel and Olivia Watson. A beautiful former British fashion model, Olivia pretends not to know that the true source of Martel's enormous wealth is drugs. And Martel, likewise, turns a blind eye to the fact he is doing business with a man whose objective is the very destruction of the West. Together, under Gabriel's skilled hand, they will become an unlikely pair of heroes in the global war on terror. </p> <p>Written in seductive and elegant prose, the story moves swiftly from the glamour of Saint-Tropez to the grit of Casablanca and, finally, to an electrifying climax that will leave listeners breathless. </p> <p>But <i>House of Spies</i> is more than just riveting entertainment; it is a dazzling tale of avarice and redemption set against the backdrop of the great conflict of our times. And it proves once again why Daniel Silva is \"quite simply the best\" (<i>Kansas City Star</i>). </p>";
