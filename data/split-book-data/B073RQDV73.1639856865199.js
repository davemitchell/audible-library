window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Every summer thousands of families head to the nation's largest water park, famous for its 21-story waterslide, the Dead Drop. This year one visitor didn't pack his bathing suit. He packed explosives. When the bomb goes off, dozens of people are instantly killed. The rest are herded into the park's massive pool by the bomber's accomplices. An organized team of fanatical but well-trained terrorists, they seal off the entrances, turn the waterslide into a watchtower, and train their sights on the families below. But one hostage isn't playing along. He's special agent Jericho Quinn. He's on vacation with his daughter. And he's about to turn this terrorist pool party into one righteous blood bath.... </p>";
