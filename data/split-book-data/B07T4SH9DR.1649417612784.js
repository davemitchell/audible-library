window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Daniel Petrovich, the most lethal operative created by the Department of Defense's Black Flagged Program, represents a new breed of covert operative.&nbsp;</p> <p>He wasn't recruited from Special Forces, law enforcement, or any of the alphabet agencies. He isn't motivated by a sense of undying patriotism or bitter revenge. He's none of those things, which makes him all the more dangerous. Unlike most \"heroes\", there's no obvious black and white in Petrovich's world. He sees everything in gray - an uncompromising trait that will keep him alive long enough to pull off one of the biggest coups in covert military history.&nbsp;</p> <p>\"Inception\" is Daniel Petrovich's origin story. The perfect place for a new listener to start the Black Flagged series.</p>";
