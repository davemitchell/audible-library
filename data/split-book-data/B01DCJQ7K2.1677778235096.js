The CIA calls him Ivan the Ghost because he's operated for years without leaving a trail or revealing his face.&nbsp;</p> <p>Until now.&nbsp;</p> <p>For the first time in history, Ivan appears to have slipped. The CIA's new director sets Agent Kyle Achilles on an intercept course, surveilling the daughter of a British politician. Then Ivan pulls off a masterful con, and Emily vanishes.&nbsp;</p> <p>With Emily's life, his career, and America's reputation at stake, Achilles partners with an unlikely new agent he meets in France. Together they attempt to get one step ahead of the legendary Russian, while rubbing elbows with the ultra-rich in a high-tech international chase.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Amazon named Tim Tigner an All-Star Author in December, 2017 and every month since for being one of the most popular authors in Kindle Unlimited.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p>";
