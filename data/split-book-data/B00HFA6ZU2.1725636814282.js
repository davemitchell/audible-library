window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>NYPD Detective Jeremy Fisk hunts an assassin working for a shadowy cartel in this action-charged second installment of Dick Wolf's <i>New York Times</i> best-selling series, a masterful thriller that blends politics, intrigue, and twisting suspense. </p> <p>A number of bodies are discovered on the United States' border with Mexico, each carved with a bizarre symbol: a hummingbird. Detective Cecilia Garza, dubbed the Ice Queen among her colleagues at the Mexican intelligence agency because she's famous for never showing an ounce of weakness, arrives at the scene and recognizes the image immediately; it is the calling card of a killer called Chuparosa, a man both feared and celebrated for his cunning and brutality. Known to be incorruptible in a seemingly lawless land, Detective Garza has pursued this killer for years, yet knows little about him, except that he's merciless and heading to New York City, along with the rest of the world. </p> <p>It's United Nations Week in Manhattan and Jeremy Fisk, an integral member of the NYPD's Intelligence Division, an antiterror unit modeled on the CIA, let his grief over a devastating loss keep him from his duty to safeguard the city and the world's most powerful leaders. Complicating matters is the startling news of a mass murder on the beach in nearby Rockaway and the arrival of a beautiful and assertive Mexican detective determined to do things her way. </p> <p>To have a chance at finding and stopping Chuparosa, these uneasy allies must meld their opposing investigative styles. They soon discover that there's much more to this threat than meets the eye, and Fisk will have to learn the hard way that justice is not always blind. </p>";
