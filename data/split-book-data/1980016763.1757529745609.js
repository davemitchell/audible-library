And it's the kind of case that makes his blood run cold...the shocking murder of a Tlingit Indian girl. </p> <p>Three people have disappeared on Prince of Wales Island. Two are crew members of the reality TV show, <i>Fishwives</i>. Cutter's job is to find the bodies, examine the crew's footage for clues, and track down the men who killed them. Easier said than done. Especially when the whole town is hiding secrets, every trail is a dead end - and the hunter becomes the hunted....</p>";
