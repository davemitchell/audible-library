Twenty years later Kyle works for the CIA while the Cobra emerges from prison to become an efficient killing machine, and he has never slackened his hatred for Swanson. </p> <p>To draw out his ultimate target, the Cobra launches a violent campaign against the United States and attacks the second-largest shopping mall in America.
