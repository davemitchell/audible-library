window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A propulsive, high-stakes debut thriller where one extraordinary operator holds the key to saving the world from Armageddon. All he needs to do is stay alive. </b> </p> <p>Buried deep in the US defense and special forces architecture is an elite, ultra-black unit created expressly to prevent weapons of mass destruction from falling into the hands of terrorists and rogue regimes. Their covert, surgical strikes eliminate grave threats so the rest of America can sleep without fear. Until now. </p> <p>After returning from a successful operation in Pakistan, the entire team is assassinated within 48 hours. Only their leader, Michael Garin, survives. </p> <p>As the sole survivor and chief suspect of the attack, Garin finds himself on the run from Iranian intelligence operatives bent on tracking and killing him. Even Garin's own government appears to have turned against him, sending a lethal sniper from the vaunted Delta Force to eliminate the threat they think he's become. </p> <p>With enemies coming at him from every direction, Garin's fight for survival becomes part of a larger conspiracy unfolding on the world's stage: a catastrophic attack - precipitated by escalating tensions in the Middle East - that will shift the balance of power and plunge the United States of America into oblivion. </p>";
