She is pretty, feminine, assertive and a guy’s guy kind of girl, who smokes cigars and drinks whisky with the best of’em.

And one by one everyone on that list is dying.</p> <p>Mason and Gallin are assigned to protect her and find the authors of the list. At first it seems a simple enough task, until, after a particularly gruesome killing, Mason finds the other half of the list; the half no one knew existed, the half he is on.</p> <p>Then things get heavy….</p>";
