window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In <i>Black Fall</i>, the third book in the ITW Award-nominated series that began with the self-published phenomenon <i>Angel Killer</i>, magician-turned-FBI agent Jessica Blackwood investigates a series of seemingly unrelated but equally bizarre and sinister crimes that lead her to the Colorado desert and a town that has simply disappeared. </p> <p>With two big cases under her belt, FBI agent Jessica Blackwood is learning to embrace her unconventional past as the rising star in a family dynasty of illusionists. Her talent and experience endow her with a unique understanding of the power and potential of deception and a gift for knowing when things are not always as they appear to be. Once resenting her eccentric grandfather, a brilliant magician in his own right, Jessica now sees him as a mentor and regularly seeks his advice about her work. </p> <p>But Jessica's routine surveillance operation becomes a fight for survival when a disturbed young woman, clutching a baby, shows up at the stakeout location and threatens to kill her child. On the same day, an hour after a severe earthquake rocks the Eastern seaboard, a strange video goes viral. Nobel Prize-winning physicist Peter Devon has been dead for eight years, yet here he is on camera, predicting the location and date of the earthquake. </p> <p>Jessica is put on the case by her boss, Dr. Ailes, but when Detective Aileen Lewis reports that they've found a Jane Doe who matches her description of her attacker, she's torn between professional duty and a personal desire to find out who the woman was, and why she was killed. The investigations pull her in very different directions - until they start to converge, leading Jessica to confront something darker and more powerful than anyone expected. Something so twisted, only one person could be behind it...the Warlock. </p>";
