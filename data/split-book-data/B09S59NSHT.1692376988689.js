Their search for answers will take them deeper into the world of conspiracy and fake news than they ever expected.&nbsp;</p> <p>Treadstone and Blackbriar may be two sides of the same coin, intelligence and counterintelligence, but they have one thing in common, answers can be the deadliest commodity of all.</p>";
