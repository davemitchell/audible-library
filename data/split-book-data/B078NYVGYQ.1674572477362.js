window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Wyoming game warden Joe Pickett has two cases to contend with, both of them lethal, in the electrifying new novel from the number-one </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author.</b></p> <p>Wyoming's new governor isn't sure what to make of Joe Pickett, but he has a job for him that is extremely delicate. A prominent female British executive never came home from the high-end guest ranch she was visiting, and the British Embassy is pressing hard. Pickett knows that happens sometimes - these ranches are stocked with handsome young cowboys, and \"ranch romances\" aren't uncommon. But no sign of her months after she vanished? That suggests something else.</p> <p>At the same time, his friend Nate Romanowski has asked Joe to intervene with the feds on behalf of falconers who can no longer hunt with eagles even though their permits are in order. Who is blocking the falconers and why?&nbsp;</p> <p>The more he investigates both cases, the more someone wants him to go away. Is it because of the missing woman or because he's become Nate's advocate? Or are they somehow connected? The answers, when they come, will be even worse than he'd imagined.</p>";
