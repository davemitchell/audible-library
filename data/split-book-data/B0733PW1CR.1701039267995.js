How do they endure and thrive while most books, movies, songs, video games, and pieces of art disappear quickly after initial success? How can we create and market creative works that achieve longevity?&nbsp;</p> <p>Holiday explores this mystery by drawing on his extensive experience working with businesses and creators such as Google, American Apparel, and the author John Grisham as well as his interviews with the minds behind some of the greatest perennial sellers of our time. His fascinating examples include:&nbsp;</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Rick Rubin, producer for Adele, Jay-Z, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers, who teaches his artists to push past short-term thinking and root their work in long-term inspiration.&nbsp;</li> <li>Tim Ferriss, whose books have sold millions of copies, in part because he rigorously tests every element of his work to see what generates the strongest response.&nbsp;</li> <li><i>Seinfeld</i>, which managed to capture both the essence of the '90s and timeless themes to become a modern classic.&nbsp;</li> <li>Harper Lee, who transformed a muddled manuscript into <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i> with the help of the right editor and feedback.&nbsp;</li> <li>Winston Churchill, Stefan Zweig, and Lady Gaga, who each learned the essential tenets of building a platform of loyal, dedicated supporters.&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p>Holiday reveals that the key to success for many perennial sellers is that their creators don't distinguish between the making and the marketing. The product's purpose and audience are in the creator's mind from day one. By thinking holistically about the relationship between their audience and their work, creators of all kinds improve the chances that their offerings will stand the test of time.&nbsp;</p>";
