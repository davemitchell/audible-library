window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The desire to kill is becoming contagious in this riveting novel of conceivable mad science by </b><b><i>The Wall Street Journal</i></b><b> bestselling author of </b><b><i>The Naturalist</i></b><b>. </b></p> <p>Computational biologist and serial-killer hunter Dr. Theo Cray receives an off-the-record request from the FBI to investigate an inexplicable double homicide. It happened at the excavation site where a murderer had buried his victims’ remains. In custody is a forensic technician in shock, with no history of aggression. He doesn’t remember a thing. His colleagues don’t even recognize the man they thought they knew. But an MRI reveals something peculiar. And abnormal. </p> <p>What on earth made him commit murder? </p> <p>After discovering that a mysterious man has been stalking crime scenes and stealing forensic data, Cray has a radical and terrifying theory. Now he must race against time to find a darker version of himself: a scientist with an obsession in pathological behavior who uses his genius not to catch serial killers - but to create them.</p>";
