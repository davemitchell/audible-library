window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>John Rain is back. And “the most charismatic assassin since James Bond” (<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>) is up against his most formidable enemy yet: the nexus of political, military, media, and corporate factions known only as the Oligarchy. </p> <p>When legendary black ops veteran Colonel Scott “Hort” Horton tracks Rain down in Tokyo, Rain can’t resist the offer: a multi-million dollar payday for the “natural causes” demise of three ultra-high-profile targets who are dangerously close to launching a coup in America. But the opposition on this job is going to be too much for even Rain to pull it off alone. He’ll need a detachment of other deniable irregulars: his partner, the former Marine sniper, Dox. Ben Treven, a covert operator with ambivalent motives and conflicted loyalties. And Larison, a man with a hair trigger and a secret he’ll kill to protect. </p> <p>From the shadowy backstreets of Tokyo and Vienna, to the deceptive glitz and glamour of Los Angeles and Las Vegas, and finally to a Washington, D.C. in a permanent state of war, these four lone wolf killers will have to survive presidential hit teams, secret CIA prisons, and a national security state as obsessed with guarding its own secrets as it is with invading the privacy of the populace. But first, they’ll have to survive each other. </p> <p><i>The Detachment</i> is what fans of Eisler, “one of the most talented and literary writers in the thriller genre” (<i>Chicago Sun-Times</i>), have been waiting for: the worlds of the award-winning Rain series, and of the best-selling <i>Fault Line</i> and <i>Inside Out</i>, colliding in one explosive thriller as real as today’s headlines and as frightening as tomorrow’s.</p>";
