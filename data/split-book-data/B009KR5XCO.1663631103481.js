window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>New York Times </i>best-selling author Nelson DeMille returns with another heart-pounding John Corey thriller - this time including Coreyâ€™s FBI agent wife Kate Mayfield...and their mission is to catch an elusive terrorist mastermind before he catches them.</p> <p>Anti-terrorist Task Force agent John Corey and his wife, FBI agent Kate Mayfield, have been posted overseas to Sana'a, Yemen-one of the most dangerous places in the Middle East. While there, they will be working with a small team to track down one of the masterminds behind the USS <i>Cole</i> bombing: A high-ranking Al Qaeda operative known as The Panther. Ruthless and elusive, he's wanted for multiple terrorist acts and murders - and the US Government is determined to bring him down, no matter the cost. As latecomers to a deadly game, John and Kate don't know the rules, the players, or the score. What they do know is that there is more to their assignment than meets the eye - and that the hunters are about to become the hunted.</p> <p>Filled with breathtaking plot turns and told in John Corey's inimitable voice, <i>The Panther </i>is a brilliant depiction of one of the most treacherous countries in the world and raises disturbing questions about whether we can ever know who our enemies - or our allies - really are.</p>";
