And as evidenced by his ever-growing Boston empire, he doesn’t get his hands dirty. Usually.</p> <p>Joe DeMarco, on the other hand, is paid to get his hands dirty. So when John Mahoney, the former Speaker of the House, calls, DeMarco knows it’s time to get to work. Brian Lewis, an intern for Mahoney, has been found dead, seemingly from a drug overdose.

In a city full of shadowy agreements and duplicitous deals, DeMarco will soon learn that to get to the bottom of Brian’s death, he’ll have to look at people perched the very top of the world.</p>";
