The two events seem unrelated, but as suspicions rise, the CIA calls in its premier operative, David Slaton. </p> <p>When wreckage from the aircraft is discovered on a remote Arctic island, Slaton and a team are sent on a clandestine mission to investigate. While they comb a frigid Russian island at the top of the world, disaster strikes yet again: a US Navy destroyer sinks in the Black Sea. </p> <p>Evidence begins mounting that these disparate events are linked, controlled by an unseen hand.
