After just weeks on the job, she’s called to a scene by railroad tracks - a woman’s body has been shockingly displayed, her throat cut down to the spine - and as Scarpetta begins to follow the trail, it leads unnervingly close to her own historic neighborhood.</p> <p>At the same time, a catastrophe occurs in a top secret labo­ratory in outer space, endangering at least two scientists aboard. Appointed to the highly classified Doomsday Commission that specializes in sensitive national security cases, Scarpetta is summoned to the White House and tasked with finding out exactly what happened. But even as she remotely works the first potential crime scene in space, an apparent serial killer strikes again very close to home.</p> <p>This latest novel in the groundbreaking Kay Scarpetta series captivates listeners with the shocking twists, high-wire tension, and forensic detail that Patricia Cornwell is famous for, proving once again why she’s the world’s number one best-selling crime writer.</p>";
