window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In the riveting conclusion of the 4MK trilogy, Barker takes the thriller to an entirely new level. Don't miss a single word of the series James Patterson called \"ingenious.\"&nbsp;</p> <p>Hear No Evil&nbsp;</p> <p>For Detective Sam Porter, the words \"Father, forgive me\" conjure memories long forgotten; a past intentionally buried. For Anson Bishop, these three words connect a childhood to the present as he unleashes a truth concealed for decades.&nbsp;</p> <p>See No Evil&nbsp;</p> <p>Found written on cardboard near each body, these words link multiple victims to a single killer - discovered within minutes of each other in both Chicago and South Carolina - clearly connected yet separated by impossible miles.&nbsp;</p> <p>Speak No Evil&nbsp;</p> <p>Chicago Metro and the FBI find themselves caught in chaos - a hospital on lockdown, a rogue officer, and corruption at the highest levels. When Anson Bishop, the prime suspect in the notorious 4MK serial murders turns himself in, he reveals a story completely unexpected, one that not only upends the current investigation, but one that will change the lives of all involved.&nbsp;</p> <p>Do No Evil&nbsp;</p> <p>With unrelenting tension and pulse-pounding suspense, the past unravels at breakneck speed as the truth behind the Four Monkey Killer's motive is finally revealed in this masterfully crafted finale.</p>";
