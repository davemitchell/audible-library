window.bookSummaryJSON = "<b>Instant <i>New York Times </i>Bestseller</b><br> <br><b>From award-winning journalist Kara Swisher comes a witty, scathing, but fair accounting of the tech industry and its founders who wanted to change the world but broke it instead.</b><br> <br><b>“Swisher, the bad-ass journalist and OG chronicler of Silicon Valley…takes no prisoners in this highly readable look at the evolution of the digital world…Bawdy, brash, and compulsively thought-provoking, just like its author, </b><i><b>Burn Book </b></i><b>sizzles” (<i>Booklist</i>, starred review).</b><br><br>Part memoir, part history, <i>Burn Book</i> is a necessary chronicle of tech’s most powerful players. From “the queen of all media” (Walt Mossberg, <i>The </i><i>Wall Street Journal</i>), this is the inside story we’ve all been waiting for about modern Silicon Valley and the biggest boom in wealth creation in the history of the world.<br> <br>When tech titans crowed that they would “move fast and break things,” Kara Swisher was moving faster and breaking news. While covering the explosion of the digital sector in the early 1990s, she developed a long track record of digging up and reporting the facts about this new world order. Her consistent scoops drove one CEO to accuse her of “listening in the heating ducts” and prompted Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg to once observe: “It is a constant joke in the Valley when people write memos for them to say, ‘I hope Kara never sees this.’”<br> <br> While still in college, Swisher got her start at <i>The</i> <i>Washington Post</i>, where she became one of the few people in journalism interested in covering the nascent Internet. She went on to work for <i>The</i> <i>Wall</i> <i>Street Journal</i>, joining with Walt Mossberg to start the groundbreaking <i>D: All Things Digital </i>conference, as well as pioneering tech news sites.<br> <br>Swisher has interviewed everyone who matters in tech over three decades, right when they presided over an explosion of world-changing innovation that has both helped and hurt our world. Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Sheryl Sandberg, Bob Iger, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Meg Whitman, Peter Thiel, Sam Altman, and Mark Zuckerberg are just a few whom Swisher made sweat—figuratively and, in Zuckerberg’s case, literally.<br> <br>Despite the damage she chronicles, Swisher remains optimistic about tech’s potential to help solve problems and not just create them. She calls upon the industry to make better, more thoughtful choices, even as a new set of powerful AI tools are poised to change the world yet again. At its heart, this book is a love story to, for, and about tech from someone who knows it better than anyone.";
