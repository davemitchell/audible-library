window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Scott Brick brings to life a heart-stopping, critically acclaimed, and best-selling international thriller.</p> <p>Even after they retire, crisis&nbsp;negotiators are haunted by the principle&nbsp;rule of dealing with violent terrorists: Just because the hostages have been released, it doesn't mean it's over.</p> <p>Warning!&nbsp;Highly&nbsp;addictive escapism disguised as fiction. Only commit to this experience if you can tolerate pure adrenaline.</p> <p><i>Publishers Weekly</i> review: \"The audio production of Khalifa’s twisty thriller begins with a terrorist takeover of a Manhattan skyscraper and features a spirited reading by Brick. Former FBI agent Alex Blackwell is dragged from retirement to handle a hostage situation in a New York City high-rise.</p> <p>\"Seth, the terrorist leader, demands a safe escape and a trade—the kidnapped daughter of an influential senator for the release of two bombers imprisoned in Egypt. Once the deal is struck and completed, Blackwell vows to hunt down Seth, and his quest is interrupted by chapters featuring Sam Morgan, a Southern California software developer who’s lured to a new job in New York City.</p> <p>\"The way the stories connect is clever and shocking. The plot hops around the globe, giving Brick’s international accents a workout. Brick’s clipped, precise performance makes the most of the surprising finale. The result is a totally satisfying audiobook.\"</p>";
