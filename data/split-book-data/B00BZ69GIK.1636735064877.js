A top-secret prototype stealth fighter is destroyed during a test flight. Witnesses on the ground say that it was shot down by a craft that immediately vanished at impossible speeds. All over the world, reports of UFOs are increasing at an alarming rate. And in a remote fossil dig in China dinosaur hunters have found something that is definitely not of this earth. There are rumors of alien-human hybrids living among us. </p> <p>Joe Ledger and the Department of Military Sciences rush headlong into the heat of the worldâ€™s strangest and deadliest arms race, because the global race to recover and retro-engineer alien technologies has just hit a snag. Someone - or something - wants that technology back.</p>";
