window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Set 300 years after the events of <i>Alien: Out of the Shadows</i> and <i>Alien: River of Pain</i>, <i>Alien: Sea of Sorrows</i> deals with the rediscovery of dormant Xenomorphs (Aliens) in the abandoned mines of LV-178, the planetoid from <i>Alien: Out of the Shadows</i>, which has now been terraformed and renamed New Galveston. </p> <p>The Weyland-Yutani Corporation, reformed after the collapse of the United Systems Military, continue their unceasing efforts to weaponise the creatures, eliciting the help of Alan Decker, who is forced to join a team of mercenaries sent to investigate an ancient excavation lurking deep beneath the planet's toxic desert, dubbed the Sea of Sorrows. </p> <p>Somewhere in that long-forgotten dig lies the thing the company wants most in the universe - a living Xenomorph. Decker doesn't understand why the company needs him until his genetic heritage comes back to haunt him. Centuries ago one of his ancestors fought the Aliens, launching a bloody vendetta that was never satisfied. That was when the creatures swore revenge on his forbear, 'the Destroyer', Ellen Ripley...and all her descendants. </p> <p>This terrifying, cinematic multicast dramatisation - directed by the multiaward-winning Dirk Maggs, best known for his adaptations of Douglas Adams' <i>Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i> and Neil Gaiman's <i>Neverwhere</i> for the BBC - is the sequel to Audible Originals' <i>Alien: Out of the Shadows</i> (nominated for Best Audio Drama at the 2017 Audies) and <i>Alien: River of Pain</i>. </p> <p>Full cast: Tom Alexander, Mark Arnold, Sagar Arya, Pippa Bennett-Warner, Laurence Bouvard, Philip Bullcock, John Chancer, Stockard Channing, Cedric Cirotteau, Simon Darwen, Andrea Deck, Oris Erhuero, Tony Gardner, Walles Hamonde, Andrew James Spooner, Lorelei King, Tayla Kovacevic Ebong, Laurel Lefkow, Sandra-Mae Luyck, Theo Maggs, Alan Marriott, Gary Martin, Pauline Mclynn, Eric Meyers, Naoko Mori, Sarah Pitard, Kerry Shale, Thomas Stroppell, Emma Swan, Martin T Sherman, Steve Toussaint and Ryan Wichert. </p>";
