window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From best-selling author Brett Battles comes the first book in a spinoff series from his award-winning Jonathan Quinn thrillers. </p> <p>Ananke thought her week couldn't get worse, but as she hunts for the man who screwed up her previous job, things really go sideways. </p> <p>Turns out, she's not the only one having problems. </p> <p>Rosario can acquire anything for anyone, but can she obtain freedom for herself when her latest assignment goes awry? </p> <p>Dylan's sure his new gig will be a walk in the park - or rather, a drive, given that he's a courier. Unfortunately, the road is a bit bumpier than he expected. </p> <p>Liesel is having the worst week of her life, and blames only herself. </p> <p>And Ricky? Well, Ricky doesn't believe in bad weeks. Though he can't claim being stuck in prison is all that great. Convenient for all of them, then, that a mysterious organization comes along asking for their help, and in return promises to reverse their excommunication from the secret world. </p> <p>Of course, nothing good ever comes without strings attached. </p>";
