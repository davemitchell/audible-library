window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Unstoppable detective Harry Bosch returns in a new thriller from <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Michael Connelly. </p> <p>Harry Bosch is California's newest private investigator. He doesn't advertise, he doesn't have an office, and he's picky about who he works for, but it doesn't matter. His chops from 30 years with the LAPD speak for themselves. </p> <p>Soon one of Southern California's biggest moguls comes calling. The reclusive billionaire has less than six months to live and a lifetime of regrets. He hires Bosch to find out whether he has an heir. Using all of his cold-case skills, Bosch pieces together a 65-year-old mystery and finds out that the case is not as simple - or as cold - as he thought. </p> <p>Swift, unpredictable, and thrilling, <i>The Wrong Side of Goodbye</i> proves once again that \"Connelly is still very much in his prime\" (<i>Washington Post</i>). </p>";
