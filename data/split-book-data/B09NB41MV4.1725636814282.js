window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The son of a government scientist must be found at any cost in this taut political thriller that \"starts off explosively and keeps on rolling.\" (Joe Hartlaub, <i>BookReporter</i>)</p> <p>Deep in the American Heartland, a team of assassins goes to work. In short order, a Chechen scientist and double agent for the US government is dead. But the team didn't exactly finish the job. The man's teenage son is still alive. In possession of crucial and potentially lethal information, he's now on the run - and off the grid.</p> <p>The feds know who to call: Jonathan Grave and his elite rescue team at Security Solutions. Their mission is simple: Find the boy and keep his information out of the wrong hands. But simple doesn't mean easy. The boy has a bodyguard with unusual talents, and she's not giving up without a fight. Only by bringing them both back alive can Grave expose the traitor in the highest levels of power - and prevent an all-out nuclear war.</p>";
