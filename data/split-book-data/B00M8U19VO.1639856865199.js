The board chairman announces that the rest of the meeting will be closed, due to personnel issues. \"Issues\" is correct. The proposal up for a vote before them is whether to authorize the killing of a local reporter. The vote is four to one in favor. </p> <p>Meanwhile, not far away, Virgil Flowers is helping out a friend by looking into a dognapping, which seems to be turning into something much bigger and uglier - a team of dognappers supplying medical labs - when he gets a call from Lucas Davenport. A murdered body has been found - and the victim is a local reporter. </p>";
