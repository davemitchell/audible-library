And David is very good at what he does: manipulation, bribes, and threats - anything goes, so long as he delivers. Other agents can do nothing but watch jealously as his top-secret, high-level informant, Janus, rockets David to success. </p> <p>But after David suffers a stroke during a high-speed car chase, crashing violently into the wall of a tunnel, he wakes up in a hospital with no memory at all of Janus or the past two years of his life. David knows only that he has to reconnect with Janus to protect himself and his informants before outside forces bring the whole network crashing down. Fortunately, he has his supportive friends and colleagues to help him rebuild his life...or does he? </p> <p>From the award-winning Swedish author who has worked as a police officer and IT security consultant, <i>MemoRandom </i>is a stunning thriller and look inside the secret intelligence community, where you never know who's on your side. </p>";
