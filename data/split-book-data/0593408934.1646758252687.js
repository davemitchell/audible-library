window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The world’s most ruthlessly efficient assassin, Jason Bourne, is facing the one force he can’t defeat - his own past - in the latest thrilling entry in Robert Ludlum’s </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling series.</b></p> <p>Three years ago, Jason Bourne embarked on a mission in Estonia with his partner and lover, a fiery Treadstone agent code-named Nova. Their job was to rescue a Russian double agent who’d been smuggled out of St. Petersburg in the midst of an FSB manhunt.</p> <p>They failed. The Russian died at the hands of a shadowy assassin known only by the nickname Lennon.</p> <p>Now everything has changed for Bourne. Nova is gone, killed in a mass shooting in Las Vegas. Bourne is a lone operative, working in the shadows for Treadstone, when he’s called in for a new mission in London - to prevent another assassination masterminded by Lennon.</p> <p>But nothing about this mission is what it seems. As Bourne engages in a cat-and-mouse game with Lennon across the British countryside, he discovers that everything he thought he knew about the past was a lie. And with the body count rising, he comes to an inevitable conclusion: Some secrets should stay buried.</p>";
