But is Karin truly in love with him, or is she a spy? </p> <p>Lady Virginia is facing bankruptcy and can see no way out of her financial problems until she is introduced to the hapless Cyrus T. Grant III from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, who's in England to see his horse run at Royal Ascot. </p> <p>Sebastian Clifton is now the chief executive of Farthings Bank and a workaholic whose personal life is thrown into disarray when he falls for Nadira, a beautiful Indian girl. But her parents have already chosen the man she is going to marry. Meanwhile, Sebastian's rivals, Adrian Sloane and Desmond Mellor, are still plotting to bring him and his chairman, Hakim Bishara, down, so they can take over Farthings. </p> <p>Harry Clifton remains determined to get Anatoly Babakov released from a gulag in Siberia following the international success of his acclaimed book, <i>Uncle Joe</i>.
