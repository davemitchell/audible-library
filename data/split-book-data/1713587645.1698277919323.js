These missions may not be quite as exciting as his time in the military, but Clayton’s okay with that.

After this attempt on Veronica’s life, Clayton enters a complicated web of lies, betrayal, and dangerous government secrets.</p> <p>As Clayton gets closer to the truth, he encounters unexpected foes pitted against questionable allies. With enemies at every turn, the only constant Clayton can rely on is Veronica. But when the threat against her turns on him, too, he faces an impossible choice: love or country.</p>";
