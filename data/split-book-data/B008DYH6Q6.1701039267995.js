window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Detective Dave Robicheaux returns to center stage in an incendiary new novel by James Lee Burke. A gripping tale of racial violence, class warfare, and the sometimes cruel legacy of Southern history, <i>Sunset Limited</i> is a stunning achievement, confirming Burke's place as one of America's premier stylists as well as master storytellers. </p> <p>The 40-year-old crucifixion of a prominent labor leader named Jack Flynn remains an unsolved atrocity that has never been forgotten in New Iberia, Louisiana. When Flynn's daughter, Megan, a photojournalist drawn to controversial subjects, returns to the site of her father's murder, it quickly becomes clear that her family's blood-stained past will not stay buried. Megan gives her old friend Dave Robicheaux a tip about a small-time criminal named Cool Breeze Broussard, scarcely suspecting that the seemingly innocuous case will lead Robicheaux and his partner into the midst of a deadly conspiracy. </p> <p>Combining brilliant prose, crackling suspense, and an exquisite sense of character and place, <i>Sunset Limited</i> is a wrenching tale of historic violence and soiled redemption that reveals one of America's finest novelists at his masterful best.</p>";
