Unfortunately it's not as easy to leave behind the memory of a shattering personal loss - but for the time being, he can always take the edge off with a stiff drink and a round of darts. <p>But when the news of Eddie Cochran's death reaches him, Hardy is propelled back into all the things he was trying to escape - and forced to untangle a web of old secrets and raw passions, for the sake of Eddie's pregnant widow, Frannie, and for the others whose lives may still be at risk.</p>";
