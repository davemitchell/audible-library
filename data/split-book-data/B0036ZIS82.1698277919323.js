window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Jane Whitefield, the fearless \"guide\" who helps people in trouble disappear, has just begun her quiet new life as Mrs. Carey McKinnon when she is called upon again to face her toughest opponents yet. Jane must try to save a young girl fleeing a deadly mafioso. The deceptively simple task of hiding the girl propels Jane into the center of horrific events and pairs her with Bernie the Elephant, the Mafia's moneyman. Bernie has a photographic memory, and in order to undo an evil that has been growing for half a century, he and Jane engineer the biggest theft of all time---stealing billions from hidden Mafia accounts---only to face the unprecedented problem of what to do with that much money. </p>";
