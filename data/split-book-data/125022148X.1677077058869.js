window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"The narration truly shines in the vast range of accents Fliakos expertly employs...a complete experience.\" (Booklist)</b></p> <p><b>As the brutal Russian mafia becomes the most powerful and deadly criminal enterprise in the US, it’s up to covert operative Rob Tacoma to fight back, in a new series by </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best seller Ben Coes.</b></p> <p>Ruthless, clever, and unbelievably violent, the Russian mafia has rapidly taken over the criminal underworld in the US, and law enforcement has been unable to stem the tide. When a powerful Russian mob family declares war by publicly executing two high-profile American politicians, the message is unmistakable - opposition will be met with overwhelming deadly force. With no other viable options, the President creates a clandestine assassinations team to find and eliminate the unreachable men running this deadly criminal operation.</p> <p>The CIA recruits two Tier 1 operators - former Navy SEALs Billy Cosgrove and Rob Tacoma. But before they can even get started, the Russians act - murdering Cosgrove in his own home. Now Tacoma is on his own against an organization with endless resources and no boundaries. Step one requires the near impossible - find and kill the hidden mob boss behind Cosgrove’s death. To do this, he’ll have to take on an army in a battle where there are no rules and no limits.</p>";
