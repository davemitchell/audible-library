window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>If space doesn't kill David Dixon, Earth will. </p> <p>Astronaut David Dixon's first mission to space goes horribly awry when a gunfight breaks out on a Russian space station. He finds himself making an emergency landing from orbit and becomes the most wanted man on Earth. Desperate to unravel the plot he's found himself in, he takes his pursuers on a wild chase from space to the backstreets of Rio and beyond. Dixon's survival relies on his skills as a pilot and willingness to do whatever it takes, from crashing a passenger jet into the Mexican desert to pulling off an incredible heist in Low Earth Orbit. </p>";
