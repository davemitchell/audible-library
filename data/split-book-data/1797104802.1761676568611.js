Many of his novellas have been made into iconic films, including <i>The Body</i> (<i>Stand by Me</i>) and <i>Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption</i> (<i>Shawshank Redemption</i>).</p> <p>Four brilliant new tales in <i>If It Bleeds</i> are sure to prove as iconic as their predecessors. Once again, King’s remarkable range is on full display. In the title story, fan-favorite Holly Gibney (from the Mr. Mercedes trilogy and <i>The Outsider</i>) must face her fears and possibly another outsider - this time on her own. In <i>Mr. Harrigan’s Phone</i> an intergenerational friendship has a disturbing afterlife. <i>The Life of Chuck</i> explores, beautifully, how each of us contains multitudes. And in <i>Rat</i>, a struggling writer must contend with the darker side of ambition.</p> <p>If these novellas show King’s range, they also prove that certain themes endure. One of King’s great concerns is evil, and in <i>If It Bleeds</i>, there’s plenty of it. There is also evil’s opposite, which in King’s fiction often manifests as friendship. Holly is reminded that friendship is not only life-affirming but can be life-saving. Young Craig befriends Mr. Harrigan, and the sweetness of this late-in-life connection is its own reward.</p> <p>“Exactly what I wanted to read right now,” said Ruth Franklin in a rave on the cover of <i>The New York Times Book Review</i>. “Phenomenal,\" said Brian Truitt in <i>USA Today</i>. “King still owns the fright business like none other.” </p>";
