window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A high-flying, high-octane thrill ride, </b><b><i>Deep Fury</i></b><b> is the long awaited seventh installment of the bestselling Cordell Logan Mysteries from author David Freed.</b></p> <p>A naked man drops from the night sky and crashes through the roof of a mobile home, nearly killing the elderly couple inside. The victim is soon identified as Pete Hostetler, a well-respected executive at a California-based toy manufacturing company. But detectives are baffled, and there are no leads. Did he accidentally fall out of an airplane or was he pushed?</p> <p>For Cordell Logan—a sardonic, financially struggling flight instructor and former government assassin—Hostetler’s death is personal. The two men were classmates at the US Air Force Academy and later served together as fighter pilots during Operation Desert Storm, where Hostetler saved Logan’s life during one particularly perilous combat mission in Iraq. Logan is convinced Pete was murdered. But who would’ve killed someone in such bizarre fashion, and why?</p> <p>Determined to avenge his battle buddy’s death, Logan starts digging and discovers nothing is as it seems, and that he may not have known Hostetler as well as he thought. Soon a vexing trail of clues lead him and his aging Cessna, the <i>Ruptured Duck</i>, across California, deep into Mexico, and relentlessly into harm’s way.</p>";
