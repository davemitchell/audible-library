But now the beloved family doctor has been accused of murdering Viola Turner, the African-American nurse with whom he worked in the dark days of the 1960s. Penn is determined to save his father, but Tom, stubbornly invoking doctor-patient privilege, refuses to even speak in his own defense. </p> <p>Penn's quest for the truth sends him deep into his father's past, where a sexually charged secret lies waiting to tear their family apart.
