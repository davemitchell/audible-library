But everything changes one cold January morning when Ellice arrives in the executive suite and finds him dead with a gunshot to his head.</p> <p>And then she walks away like nothing has happened. Why? Ellice has been keeping a cache of dark secrets, including a small-town past and a kid brother who’s spent time on the other side of the law.
