window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>#1 </b><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES</i></b><b> BEST SELLER&nbsp;• A&nbsp;classic legal thriller—with a twist. • \"A suspenseful thriller mixed with powerful themes such as false incarceration, the death penalty and how the legal system shows prejudice.” —Associated Press<br> </b><br> In the small Florida town of Seabrook, a young lawyer named Keith Russo was shot dead at his desk as he worked late one night. The killer left no clues. There were no witnesses, no one with a motive. But the police soon came to suspect Quincy Miller, a young Black man who was once a client of Russo’s.&nbsp;<br> <br> Quincy was tried, convicted, and sent to prison for life. For twenty-two years he languished in prison, maintaining his innocence. But no one was listening. He had no lawyer, no advocate on the outside. In desperation, he writes a letter to Guardian Ministries, a small nonprofit run by Cullen Post, a lawyer who is also an Episcopal minister.<br> <br> Guardian accepts only a few innocence cases at a time. Cullen Post travels the country fighting wrongful convictions and taking on clients forgotten by the system. With&nbsp;Quincy Miller, though, he gets far more than he bargained for. Powerful, ruthless people murdered Keith Russo, and they do not want Quincy Miller exonerated.<br> <br> They killed one lawyer twenty-two years ago, and they will kill another without a second thought.<br> <br> <b><i>Don’t miss John Grisham’s new book,</i></b><b> THE EXCHANGE: AFTER</b><b><i> THE FIRM, coming soon!</i></b></p>";
