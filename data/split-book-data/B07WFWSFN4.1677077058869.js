Blackmailed into executing one final mission for his previous commanding officer, Daniel's carefully constructed \"life\" rapidly disintegrates into a relentless federal manhunt - and a \"24-style\" race against the clock to suppress the shocking truth about his past. To survive, he'll release the darkest side of his concealed identity. A dark side with few boundaries - and even fewer loyalties.&nbsp;</p> <p><b><i>REDUX</i></b><b> (Book 2):</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>Two years after shocking Washington, DC with a brutal betrayal, General Terrence Sanderson prepares for a triumphant return. With his illegal covert operations group resurrected, he waits in the shadows for the right moment to demonstrate the grim necessity of the Black Flag program. His opportunity may arrive sooner than expected.&nbsp;</p> <p>At Langley, Karl Berg is appointed to a new position with the CIA's National Clandestine Service. As senior liaison to the Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Intelligence Center, he makes a disturbing discovery. Russian Federation intelligence services are secretly scouring Europe to find Anatoly Reznikov, a rogue Russian scientist at the top of every nation's WMD watch list. While the Russians pursue Reznikov, Berg goes \"off the books\" again and sends one of Sanderson's Black Flag teams to investigate.&nbsp;</p> <p><b><i>APEX</i></b><b> (Book 3):</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>A tense alliance between General Sanderson and the CIA narrowly averts an apocalyptic attack by Islamic fundamentalists in Europe, but ultimately fails to recover the virus canisters.
