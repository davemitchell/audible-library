With his ruthless employers on one side, his blackmailing former friends on the other, and a doomed mission ahead, Gentry would kill just to get out of this one alive. </p> <p>Every bit as thrilling, informed, and addictive as <i>The Gray Man</i>, and once again skillfully narrated by Jay Snyder, <i>On Target</i> is sure to hit the mark for thriller fans.</p>";
