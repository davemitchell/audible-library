The day will come when he's one of the best cleaners in the business, a man skilled at making bodies disappear. At the moment, however, he's a 22-year-old rookie cop, unaware his life is about to change. In a burning barn a body is found - and the fire isn't the cause of death. The detectives working the case have a pretty good idea about what went down. But Officer Oliver thinks it's something else entirely, and pursues a truth others would prefer remain hidden - others who will go to extreme lengths to keep him quiet. </p> <p>Every identity has an origin. This is Quinn's.</p>";
