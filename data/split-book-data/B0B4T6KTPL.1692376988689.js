window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>It seemed to be a cold case like any other. So much so that Stone and Dehan hadn’t even considered reviewing it—until private investigator Karl Baxter requested a copy of the police file. Then Stone got curious.&nbsp;</p> <p>Why did a second-rate PI in the Bronx want to look into the case of a low-life petty criminal found tied to a chair in his apartment, beaten and shot through the heart? And that question led to other questions, like, whose was second pool of blood on the floor? If there was a second victim, where was the body?&nbsp;</p> <p>Unfortunately, a chat with Baxter only raises more questions that threaten to drive Stone crazy: Who is the mysterious Tamara Gunthersen? And what was the gig she did for the even more mysterious Geronimo dos Santos, back in 2015? At every turn, the questions get deeper, and the women more tempting—and more dangerous. Until the strain on Stone and Dehan’s partnership threatens to make it snap.&nbsp;</p> <p>Then Stone will be on his own....</p>";
