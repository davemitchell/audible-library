window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>2023 Audie Award Finalist for Best Male Narrator</b></p> <p><b>An Amazon Charts, </b><b><i>Washington Post</i></b><b>, and </b><b><i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><b> bestselling series.</b></p> <p><b>In this pulse-racing thriller by the </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author of </b><b><i>The Last Agent</i></b><b>, an American sleeper cell in Russia goes silent—and it’s one man’s duty to find them.</b></p> <p>After a harrowing escape from Russian agents on his last mission, Charles Jenkins thinks he’s finally done with the spy game. But then the final two of the seven sisters—American assets who have been deep undercover in Russia for decades—cut off all communication with their handlers. Are they in hiding after detecting surveillance? Or have they turned and become double agents? It’s Jenkins’s duty to find out, but he’s been added to a Russian kill list. It will require all of Jenkins’s knowledge of spycraft—and an array of disguises—to return to the country undetected.</p> <p>But plans go awry his first night in Moscow when Jenkins gets involved in an altercation that ends in the death of the son of one of Russia’s most powerful organized crime leaders. Pursued by mafia henchmen, Russian agents, and a particularly dogged Moscow police detective, Jenkins is determined to track down the final two sisters and get them to America—or die trying. As various forces close in, Jenkins fears this time he might’ve pushed his luck too far.</p>";
