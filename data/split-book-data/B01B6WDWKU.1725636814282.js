window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The blistering sequel to <i>The Ascendant</i>: an action-packed thriller starring a bond trader turned antihero. Unlikely patriot Garrett Reilly can identify threats against America from both inside and outside the nation's borders. But now the whole world economy is at risk.... </p> <p>Garrett Reilly sees what others do not: numbers, patterns, a nation on the brink of collapse. His unique talents saved countries from falling into a world war in <i>The Ascendant</i>. But it also made him a marked man - marked by terrorist groups; marked by the US government. </p> <p>In <i>The King of Fear</i>, Garrett recognizes a string of events that could lead to economic Armageddon in the US: banks closing, grocery shelves lying empty, the nation's currency rendered worthless. Total chaos could engulf society within a matter of days. Garrett and the Ascendant team reunite to face enemies on all sides: a wounded Russia bent on keeping its crumbling empire in place, a cyber genius fixated on Garrett, a femme fatale willing to do anything to establish a new world order. In the midst of this, Garrett must also confront his own demons: his class rage, growing paranoia, and a dependency that he cannot seem to shake. After all, it takes only one card to make the whole house fall.... </p> <p>A hero with complete disregard for rules and boundaries, Drew Chapman's rogue genius gives readers \"a wild ride through the headlines of our times\" (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i> on <i>The Ascendant</i>), and this sequel will not disappoint. </p>";
