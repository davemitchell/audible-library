window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In this tour de force - part historical thriller, part modern adventure - from the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of <i>I, Sniper</i>, Bob Lee Swagger uncovers why WWII’s greatest sniper was erased from history…and why her disappearance still matters today. </p> <p>Ludmilla \"Mili\" Petrova was once the most hunted woman on Earth, having raised the fury of two of the most powerful leaders on either side of World War II: Joseph Stalin and Adolf Hitler. </p> <p>But Kathy Reilly of <i>The Washington Post</i> doesn’t know any of that when she encounters a brief mention of Mili in an old Russian propaganda magazine, and becomes interested in the story of a legendary, beautiful female sniper who seems to have vanished from history. </p> <p>Reilly enlists former marine sniper Bob Lee Swagger to parse out the scarce details of Mili’s military service. The more Swagger learns about Mili’s last mission, the more he’s convinced her disappearance was no accident - but why would the Russian government go to such lengths to erase the existence of one of their own decorated soldiers? And why, when Swagger joins Kathy Reilly on a research trip to the Carpathian Mountains, is someone trying to kill them before they can find out? </p> <p>As Bob Lee Swagger, \"one of the finest series characters ever to grace the thriller genre, now and forever\" (<i>Providence Journal-Bulletin</i>), races to put the pieces together, <i>Sniper's Honor</i> takes listeners across oceans and time in an action-packed, compulsive listen.</p>";
