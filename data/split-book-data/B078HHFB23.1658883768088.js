Court delivers Bianca Medina to the rebels, but his job doesn't end there. She soon reveals that she has given birth to a son, the only heir to Azzam's rule - and a potent threat to the Syrian president's powerful wife. Now, to get Bianca's cooperation, Court must bring her son out of Syria alive. </p> <p>With the clock ticking on Bianca's life, he goes off the grid in a free-fire zone in the Middle East - and winds up in the right place at the right time to take a shot at bringing one of the most brutal dictatorships on earth to a close.... </p>";
