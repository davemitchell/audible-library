Parker and two cohorts stole the assets of a bank in transit, but the police heat was so great they could only escape if they left the money behind. <p> Now Parker and his associates plot to reclaim the loot, which they hid in the choir loft of an unused country church. As they implement the plan, people on both sides of the law use the forces at their command to stop Parker and grab the goods for themselves.</p> <p> Though Parker's new getaway van is an old Ford Econoline with \"Holy Redeemer Choir\" on its doors, his gang is anything but holy, and Parker will do whatever it takes to redeem his prize, no matter who gets hurt in the process.</p>";
