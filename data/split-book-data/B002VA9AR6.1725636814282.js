window.bookSummaryJSON = "Stone Barrington embarks on his most dangerous adventure yet when he takes on a job as a lawyer for a sleazy and clueless con man and ends up getting embroiled in the underworld of the New York Mafia. It started out as just another late night at Elaine's, where Stone was eating a porterhouse steak and enjoying the company of his friends. But when Herbie Fisher, a notoriously not-so-sharp swindler, walked in, the pleasant atmosphere turned to ice. <p> Herbie convinces Bill Eggers, the managing partner of Woodman &amp; Weld, to sign him on as a client, with the goal of taking down the infamous Mafia boss Carmine Datilla. And even though Stone doesn't want to have anything to do with Herbie - or the Mafia, for that matter - he is soon coerced into being Herbie's lawyer.</p> <p> With the help of his ex-partner, Dino, Stone investigates \"Datilla the Hun\", and the rest of the mob family, encountering intrigue and danger at every turn. Will Stone finally take a stand, or will he end up at the bottom of Sheepshead Bay?</p> <p>With the swift action, razor-sharp characters, and crackling dialogue that are Stuart Woods's hallmarks, <i>Fresh Disasters</i> is Woods at the very height of his storytelling powers.</p>";
