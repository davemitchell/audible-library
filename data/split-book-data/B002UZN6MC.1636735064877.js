He is suddenly forced to explore his own deadly options, a quest that leads him into the welcoming fold of \"The Commission\". <p> A vigilante group made up of people like himself, relentless streetwise operators who have each lost a loved one to violent crime, the Commission confronts the failings of a system that sets predators loose to hunt again, cleaning up society's \"mistakes\" covertly, efficiently, and permanently. But Rackley soon discovers that playing God is a fearsome task. When his new secret life starts coming unwound at an alarming speed, he is suddenly caught in the most terrifying struggle he has ever faced, a desperate battle to save everything left that's worth fighting for. </p>";
