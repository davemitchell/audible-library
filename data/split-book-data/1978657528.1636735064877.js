window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A search for a pair of serial rapists leads Livia Lone down the darkest and most dangerous trail of her life in a pulse-pounding thriller by </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author Barry Eisler.</b></p> <p>Ten years ago, the daughter of Homeland Security Investigations agent B. D. Little vanished into thin air. So did seven other girls - the crimes all bearing the same signature characteristics.</p> <p>Now the disappearances have begun again. And Agent Little’s efforts to investigate are being blocked by forces far above his pay grade. Desperate, he turns to Seattle sex-crimes detective Livia Lone, the most obsessive hunter of predators Little knows.</p> <p>Livia will need that obsessiveness, and a lot more. Because the two men Little is pursuing are fearsome. Both Special Forces veterans with a dozen tours in Iraq between them. Both sadists and serial rapists. And one, the congressman scion of the vice president of the United States - a man who will use all his power to protect his son’s secrets and further his own ambitions.</p> <p>The conspirators have all the assets and all the angles. And every reason to believe they’ll evade justice, as they always have before.</p> <p>They don’t understand that for Livia Lone, justice is only a guideline. Revenge is the rule.</p>";
