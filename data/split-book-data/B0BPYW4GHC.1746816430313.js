When you’re the world’s most successful investigative journalist, and you devote your life to exposing the crimes of the great and the powerful, you learn to expect trouble. That’s why Saul was a recluse, that’s why he had no intimate circle, no close friends….</p> <p>So one question facing Alex Mason and Captain Aila Gallin was, who was it who entered Saul’s apartment like an old friend and shot him in the face at pointblank range without flinching–just like a pro?</p> <p>The other, the one ODIN needed answered yesterday, was where was the documentary he was making about the weaponizing of nano-technology and genetic engineering? The one he claimed would overturn the constitution and destroy the military-industrial complex forever - the one that was about to trigger a coup d’état in Washington DC, and another in London.</p> <p>Their search will take Mason and Gallin from DC to London, New York, remotest Cornwall and the wilds of the Yorkshire moors–and to the terrifying truth that in our fragile democracies, the root of all power is still violence….</p>";
