Its director, Leonard Nickelby, despises amateur archaeologists, which is bad enough, but now he and his young \"assistant\" have disappeared - along with Fitzpatrick's impounded cache of rare Spanish coins and the list of uncharted wreck sites Fitz spent decades putting together. Some of Fitz's own explorations have been a little...dicey, so he can't go to the authorities. Doc is his only hope.</p> <p>But greed makes people do terrible things: rob, cheat, even kill. With stakes this high, there's no way the thieves will go quietly - and Doc's just put himself in their crosshairs.</p>";
