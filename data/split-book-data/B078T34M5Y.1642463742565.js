But knowing that he would be leaving for Mars with no plan to return didn't stop him from falling in love with Izzy. Now, at age 16, it's time to leave Earth, and he's forced to face what he must leave behind in exchange for an uncertain future. </p> <p>When the news hits that another ship is already headed to colonize Mars, and the Neo-Luddite terrorist group begins threatening the Mars One project, the mission's purpose is called into question. Is this all worth it? </p>";
