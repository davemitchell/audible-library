The time to act is now....</i> </p> <p>With these words begins Gideon Crew's latest, most dangerous, most high-stakes assignment yet. Failure will mean nothing short of the end of humankind on Earth. </p> <p>Five years ago, the mysterious and inscrutable head of Effective Engineering Solutions, Eli Glinn, led a mission to recover a gigantic meteorite - the largest ever discovered - from a remote island off the coast of South America. The mission ended in disaster when their ship, the <i>Rolvaag</i>, foundered in a vicious storm in the Antarctic waters and broke apart, sinking - along with its unique cargo - to the ocean floor. One hundred and eight crew members perished, and Eli Glinn was left paralyzed. </p> <p>But this was not all. The tragedy revealed something truly terrifying: the meteorite they tried to retrieve was not, in fact, simply a rock. Instead it was a complex organism from the deep reaches of space. </p> <p>Now that organism has implanted itself in the seabed two miles below the surface - and it is growing. If it is not destroyed, the planet will be doomed. There is only one hope: for Glinn and his team to annihilate it, a task that requires Gideon's expertise with nuclear weapons. But as Gideon and his colleagues soon discover, the \"meteorite\" has a mind of its own - and it has no intention of going quietly.... </p>";
