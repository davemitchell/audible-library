The books included are the same as the individual episodes. </p> <p>Season two picks up where season one left off. Jack Noble is dead. That's what the world believes, at least.

Jack made a mess, and now is the time to clean it up. One way or another, he's determined to repay his debt. But will it cost him his life? </p>";
