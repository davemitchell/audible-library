Its members are afforded incredible protections—considered elites, untouchables. </p> <p>But when four seconds of video is captured halfway around the world and anonymously transmitted to DC, covert wheels are set in motion, and counterterrorism operative Scot Harvath is tapped to undertake the deadliest assignment of his career. </p> <p>What begins as a favor will evolve into a globe-spanning drama of highly personal stakes played out against a backdrop of stunning international intrigue, duplicitous political gamesmanship, and the darkest, most clandestine fears of the espionage world. </p> <p>With razor-sharp plotting, richly rendered characters, and heart-stopping surprises on every page, Thor isn't just at the top of his game—he owns the entire genre. </p>";
