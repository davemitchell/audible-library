It’s not a legal battle. It’s not about who shouts the hardest or loudest. Cross-examination is daylight robbery; you go in hard and fast, grab what you need, and get the hell out.</i><br> <br>Eddie Flynn, ex con-artist-turned-defense attorney, has an impossible choice to make. His client, the widow of a man who died in a confrontation with a police officer, is seeking justice for her husband. The victim himself was accused of killing a man in a robbery gone wrong outside the St. Regis Hotel—his widow swears it’s not true, and the story’s not adding up to Flynn, either. But with his small and scrappy law firm on the brink of financial collapse, taking this to trial and losing could put them under for good.<br> <br>As Flynn digs deeper into the case, a complex web of deceit and corruption begins to emerge with farther-reaching implications than he ever imagined. After a whirlwind twenty-four hours chasing leads all throughout New York City, it all comes down to the cross-examination: will he risk his life to expose the truth?<br> <br><i>The Cross</i> is an action-packed, bingeable thriller perfect for fans of Frieda McFadden and Lee Child.";
