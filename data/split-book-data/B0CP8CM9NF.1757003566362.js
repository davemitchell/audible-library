window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the international and instant </b><b><i>New York Times </i></b><b>bestselling author John Connolly, this heart-wrenching installment of the beloved and brilliant Charlie Parker series “will leave readers breathless and shaken” (</b><b><i>Booklist</i></b><b>).</b><br> <br> In Maine, Colleen Clark stands accused of the worst crime a mother can commit: the abduction and possible murder of her child. Everyone—ambitious politicians in an election season, hardened police, ordinary folk—has an opinion on the case, and most believe she is guilty.<br> <br> Defending Colleen is the lawyer Moxie Castin, and working alongside him is the private investigator Charlie Parker, who senses the tale has another twist, one involving a husband too eager to accept his wife’s guilt, a group of fascists arming for war, a disgraced psychic seeking redemption, and an old, twisted house deep in the Maine woods, a house that should never have been built.<br> <br> A house, and what dwells beneath.</p>";
