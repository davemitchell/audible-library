window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Warning: The next attack on American soil will come from within.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>From coast to coast, our nation is witnessing a new wave of terror. Suicide bombers incite blind panic and paralyzing fear. A flight attendant tries to crash an airliner. A police officer opens fire on fans in a stadium. And at CIA headquarters, a deputy director goes on a murderous rampage. The perpetrators appear to be American - but they are covert agents in a vast network of terror, selected and trained for one purpose only: the complete annihilation of America.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Special Agent Jericho Quinn has seen the warning signs. As a classified \"instrument\" of the CIA reporting directly to the president, Quinn knows that these random acts of violence pose a clear and present danger. But Quinn may not be able to stop it. The search for terrorists has escalated into an all-out witch hunt. And somehow, Quinn's name is on the list....</p>";
