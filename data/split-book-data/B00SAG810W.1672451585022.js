Harry becomes obsessed with freeing the writer and telling his story. His wife Emma, meanwhile is the chair of Barringtons Shipping, having escaped a plot to destroy their company by bombing one of their luxury liners, and now the company is thriving. But old villains remain determined in their efforts to bring down both Emma and her family. </p> <p>From Major Alex Fisher to his friend and ally Mrs. Virginia Fenwick, Emma will have to use every tool she has to save them.
