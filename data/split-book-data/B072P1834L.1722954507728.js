window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Benjamin Carter Mason died last night. Maybe he threw himself off a bridge into Los Angeles Harbor, or maybe he burned to death in a house fire in San Pedro; it doesn't really matter. Today, Mason's starting a new life. He's back in boot camp, training for the only war left that matters a damn. </p> <p>For years their spies have been coming to Earth, learning our weaknesses. Our governments knew, but they did nothing - the prospect was too awful, the costs too high - and now the horrifying and utterly inhuman Cray are laying waste to our cities. The human race is a heartbeat away from extinction. That is unless Mason and the other men and women of Task Force OMBRA can do anything about it. </p> <p>This is a time for heroes. For killers. For Grunts. </p>";
