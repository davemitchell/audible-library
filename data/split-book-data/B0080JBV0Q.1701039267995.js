window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In this psychological thriller, Jake Cole returns to his childhood home after his elderly father nearly kills himself by setting himself on fire and plowing through a plate-glass window. Jake’s father - a great American painter - is a man whose shadow Jake has tried to outrun since he was a boy. </p> <p>Now a contractor for the FBI who possesses a unique gift for recreating crime scenes, Jake is pulled into a hauntingly familiar double homicide investigation. He recognizes the artistic signature in the slayings and realizes that he now must be after the same murderer who killed his mother when he was a child. Racing against time and a category five hurricane, Jake sets out in a race to find a monster who kills his victims in an exceptionally grisly fashion.</p>";
