The visit stirs old memories, including a girl from school who vanished without a trace. <br> <br> Blake runs into the mother of the girl, who mentions a case she's come across in Georgia, where someone is convinced their relative is still alive, fifteen years on. <br> <br> Adeline Connor was the Blood Mountain Killer's last suspected victim. She vanished without a trace.<br> <br> So why is her brother so convinced she's still alive?</p>";
