Well, not quite free, thanks to parole.<br> <br>If she behaved herself—if she was a model citizen—she would go from being a supervised parolee to a mostly unsupervised one and might eventually be able to live a normal life. A life that might not even be worth living, because she was completely broke and the only skills she had were the ones that had landed her in prison.<br> <br>So, her future looked grim, and she didn’t know what she’d do in the long term. But she did know what she was going to do next.<br> <br>She was going to kill the scumbag responsible for ruining her life. She was going to kill Joe DeMarco.";
