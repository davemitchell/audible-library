window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Acclaimed as a born storyteller by critics, Michael McGarrity packs his powerful mystery with Southwestern lore and breathtaking action. In a wicked conspiracy reaching across the Mexican border, <i>Tularosa</i> pits a jaded ex-cop against tight-lipped Army personnel, hired thugs, and smooth-talking outlaws. Forced into retirement by a crippling gunshot wound, Santa Fe policeman Kevin Kerney seeks solitude on a small New Mexico ranch far from the nearest neighbor. But when his godson disappears without a trace into the harsh, high-security desert of the White Sands Missile Range, Kerney emerges to search for the young soldier. His probing questions lead him on a perilous journey across the stark, sun-beaten wilderness deep into the shadowy, cutthroat alleys of a lawless border town. </p> <p>With the winning combination of complex, believable characters and a brilliantly crafted plot, it’s easy to see why <i>Publishers Weekly</i> named <i>Tularosa</i> Best Book of the Year. With George Guidall’s dramatic narration, the rugged Southwestern backdrop and each of the colorful inhabitants burst vividly from the page.</p>";
