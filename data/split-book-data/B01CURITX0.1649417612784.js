window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Jammer Davis has spent most of his life investigating aircraft accidents. When a small regional jet disappears over the jungles of Colombia, it is a tragedy like dozens of others he has seen...but for one terrible detail, his young daughter, who was en route to a semester abroad in South America, is listed on the passenger manifest. </p> <p>A distraught Davis rushes to Bogot√° and bulls his way into the inquiry. When the wreckage is located, it becomes clear the crash was unsurvivable. As the investigation gains momentum, the facts go astray. Two pilots had been shot before the crash, along with one passenger. The possibility of a hijacking looms large as the search begins to focus on two passengers who boarded the plane, yet their remains cannot be found. </p> <p>Davis uncovers an even more sinister plot behind the entire disaster - one that goes to the highest levels of the United States government. But how could it possibly involve his daughter? </p>";
