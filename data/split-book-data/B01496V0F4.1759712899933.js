America's greatest sniper has spent the better part of two years up in the mountains of Montana, waiting for the government to double-cross him and try to come get him. He has good reason to be wary. The government has betrayed him twice already, but Nick's a hard man to kill. And just waiting in isolation, with his wife Anne gone and his paranoia at dangerous levels, is killing him day by day. </p><p>And so Nick ventures out. Carefully, like Nick does everything. But what Nick doesn't know is that the Mexican government stands on the verge of complete collapse. A brilliant madman has united the drug cartels into a deadly alliance, and the Mexican president holds a perilous grip on power. Now, Mexico's leading businessman - a multibillionaire who owns much of the country - is about to exit the country, selling off his businesses and taking his capital out of the country. Such a move would lead to an exodus of other businesses, and just like that America would face one of its largest catastrophes in recent times: a third world country on its borders, run by a drug cartel whose reach spans from South America into deep within the United States. </p><p>America has already sent special forces to deal with this cartel, but that proved a catastrophe. The country needs Nick Woods again, and it needs him now. </p>";
