window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>#1 </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author Nelson DeMille returns with a “genuinely thrilling” (</b><b><i>The New York Times</i></b><b>) suspense novel featuring his most popular series character, former NYPD homicide detective John Corey, called out of retirement to investigate a string of grisly murders much too close to home.</b><br> <br> Nelson DeMille introduced readers and listeners to NYPD Homicide Detective John Corey in <i>Plum Island</i>, who we first meet sitting on the back porch of his uncle’s waterfront estate on Long Island, recovering from wounds incurred in the line of duty.<br> <br> Six novels later, <i>The Maze</i> opens with Corey on the same porch, having survived new law enforcement roles and romantic relationships—wiser and more sarcastic than ever. Corey is restless and looking for action, so when his former lover Detective Beth Penrose appears with a job offer, Corey has to once again make some decisions about his career—and about reuniting with Beth.<br> <br> Inspired by and based on the actual and still-unsolved Gilgo Beach murders, <i>The Maze</i> takes us on a dangerous hunt for an apparent serial killer who has murdered nine—and maybe more—sex workers and hidden their bodies in the thick undergrowth on a lonely stretch of beach.<br> <br> As Corey digs deeper into this case, he comes to suspect that the failure of the local police to solve this sensational mystery may not be a result of their incompetence—it may be something else. Something more sinister.</p> <p><i>The Maze</i> features John Corey’s politically incorrect humor, matched by his brilliant and unorthodox investigative skills, along with the shocking plot twists that are the trademark of the bestselling author Nelson DeMille, “the master of smart, entertaining suspense” (<i>Bookreporter</i>).</p>";
