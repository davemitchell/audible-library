window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>USA Today </i></b><b>best-selling author Ward Larsen's globe-trotting, hard-hitting assassin, David Slaton, returns for another breathless adventure!</b></p> <p>In a Syrian palace, the presidents of Russia and Iran undertake a clandestine meeting. No staff or advisors are permitted in the room. No records are kept. By necessity, however, there are two witnesses: the interpreters. The Russian, Ludmilla Kravchuk, returns to her hotel room burdened by what she has heard. When her Iranian counterpart is murdered before her eyes, Kravchuk fears she is next and goes into hiding in Syria.</p> <p>The CIA gets word of the defection. Desperate to uncover the purpose of the meeting, they task their newest off-the-books operator - legendary assassin David Slaton - to undertake a daring rescue. Deep inside Syria’s war-torn borders, what Slaton finds is a plot that will tear the Middle East apart. And one that only he can stop.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>A Macmillan Audio production from Forge Books </b></p> <p><b>“Highly reminiscent of Robert Ludlum’s Jason Bourne series.” (David Hagberg, </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author)</b></p>";
