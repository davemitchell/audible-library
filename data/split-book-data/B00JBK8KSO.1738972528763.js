But now the beloved family doctor has been accused of murdering Viola Turner, the African-American nurse with whom he worked in the dark days of the 1960s. Penn is determined to save his father, but Tom, stubbornly invoking doctor-patient privilege, refuses to even speak in his own defense. </p> <p>Penn's quest for the truth sends him deep into his father's past, where a sexually charged secret lies waiting to tear their family apart. This long-buried sin is only a single thread in a conspiracy of greed and murder involving the vicious Double Eagles, an offshoot of the KKK. Penn is forced to confront the most wrenching dilemma of his life: Does a man of honor choose his father or the truth? </p> <p>Drenched in southern atmosphere, <i>Natchez Burning</i> marks the brilliant return of a genuine American master of suspense. Tense, disturbing, and filled with electrifying plot twists, this novel commences the most explosive and ambitious story Greg Iles has ever written.</p>";
