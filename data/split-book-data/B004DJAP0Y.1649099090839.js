window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Four-time Emmy Award winner David Hyde Pierce is famous for playing the lovably self-important Dr. Niles Crane in the hit TV series Frasier. Now, he brings the same wit and charming arrogance to his Signature Classics performance of Jonathan Swift’s <i>Gulliver’s Travels</i>.</p> <p>More than just a mock travel book and fabulous adventure, <i>Gulliver’s Travels</i> is a character study and social satire that skewers politics, science, religion, philosophy, and pretentiousness with a bite and resonance that remains as fresh today as the day it was published. Maybe that’s why it hasn’t been out of print in nearly 300 years.</p> <p>Set sail with David Hyde Pierce for a smart, fun, new <i>Gulliver’s Travels</i> experience that’s unlike any other. And stay tuned for more one-of-a-kind performances from actors Leelee Sobiesky, Casey Affleck, Tim Curry, and more, only from Audible Signature Classics.</p>";
