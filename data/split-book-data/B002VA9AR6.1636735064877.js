It started out as just another late night at Elaine's, where Stone was eating a porterhouse steak and enjoying the company of his friends. But when Herbie Fisher, a notoriously not-so-sharp swindler, walked in, the pleasant atmosphere turned to ice. <p> Herbie convinces Bill Eggers, the managing partner of Woodman &amp; Weld, to sign him on as a client, with the goal of taking down the infamous Mafia boss Carmine Datilla. And even though Stone doesn't want to have anything to do with Herbie - or the Mafia, for that matter - he is soon coerced into being Herbie's lawyer.</p> <p> With the help of his ex-partner, Dino, Stone investigates \"Datilla the Hun\", and the rest of the mob family, encountering intrigue and danger at every turn. Will Stone finally take a stand, or will he end up at the bottom of Sheepshead Bay?</p> <p>With the swift action, razor-sharp characters, and crackling dialogue that are Stuart Woods's hallmarks, <i>Fresh Disasters</i> is Woods at the very height of his storytelling powers.</p>";
