Eric Maikranz’s electrifying debut novel, </b><b><i>The Reincarnationist Papers</i></b><b>, which was the inspiration for the Paramount Pictures film </b><b><i>Infinite</i></b><b>.</b></p> <p>Evan Michaels is back in a new life as a Syrian refugee. When strange memories of his former lives lead him back to Zurich, headquarters of his old family of fellow reincarnationists, the Cognomina, he must reacquire their trust to rejoin their ranks.</p> <p>On the last leg of this journey, he is intercepted by an excommunicated member of the Cognomina who holds some serious grudges. She’s on a mission to wipe out large portions of the world’s population to save the planet from destruction. She proposes a union of the Cognomina and her own group of reincarnationists, but her true goals are dark indeed, and her resources are vast.</p> <p>Evan finds himself at the start of a war between two factions of immortal beings, each with a radically different vision for life on earth.</p>";
