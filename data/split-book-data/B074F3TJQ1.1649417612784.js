window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Class reunions: a time for memories - good, bad, and, as Virgil Flowers is about to find out, deadly - in the thrilling new novel in the number one <i>New York Times</i> best-selling series.</b> </p> <p>Virgil knows the town of Trippton, Minnesota, a little too well. A few years back, he investigated the corrupt - and, as it turned out, homicidal - local school board, and now the town's back in view with more alarming news: A woman's been found dead, frozen in a block of ice. There's a possibility that it might be connected to a high school class of 20 years ago that has a midwinter reunion coming up, and so, wrapping his coat a little tighter, Virgil begins to dig into 20 years' worth of traumas, feuds, and bad blood. In the process one thing becomes increasingly clear to him. It's true what they say: High school is murder. </p>";
