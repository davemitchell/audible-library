window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The Gateway Project is going to save the world. </b></p> <p><b>Maybe.</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>Dr. Abby Corman has a bold idea: open a stable doorway between our world and an uninhabited parallel Earth. A new world we can use to mine resources to end poverty, grow enough food to end all hunger, and allow for population growth to end overcrowding. What could be a more noble aspiration for a brilliant young scientist?&nbsp;</p> <p>But the path to hell is paved with good intentions....</p> <p>The Gateway is in a secure lab in a huge office building in New York. Ultra-modern, impenetrable by industrial spies or foreign agents, totally secure. Once it goes into lockdown for the Gateway test firing, it becomes the worldâ€™s largest and most unbreakable vault. Locked doors, though, can do more than keep bad things out. They can keep bad things <i>in</i>.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Bewilderness: Threshold</i> is the first part of a sprawling science fiction epic packed with weird science, corporate greed, betrayal, and horror. An Audible Original by <i>New York Times</i> best seller Jonathan Maberry, author of <i>Patient Zero</i> and <i>V-Wars</i>.</p>";
