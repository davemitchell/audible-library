window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Something happened that night in the woods at Camp Red Hawk. But all Joel and Leah can recall is sneaking out for a late hike with five camp friends - and that only the two of them and their friend Mike returned. They have no memory of what happened to the others. No memory of anything after leaving the camp. </p> <p>In the years that follow, they realize something has changed inside of them. They are different from others in ways they never should be. In ways that send their lives down disturbing and terrifying paths. As they grapple with adulthood, their only hope for understanding why they've been altered lies with them finding each other again. But how is that possible when their memories of one another have been erased? </p>";
