window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>#1</b><b><i> New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author C. J. Box's </b><b><i>Treasure State</i></b><b> finds Cassie Dewell in Montana on the trail of a con man.</b></p> <p>Private Investigator Cassie Dewell’s business is thriving, and her latest case puts her on the hunt for a slippery con man who’s disappeared somewhere in the “treasure state”. A wealthy Florida widow has accused him of absconding with her fortune, and wants Cassie to find him and get it back. The trail takes Cassie to Anaconda, Montana, a quirky former copper mining town that’s the perfect place to reinvent yourself. As the case develops, Cassie begins to wonder if her client is telling her everything.</p> <p>On top of that, Cassie is also working what's easily one of her strangest assignments ever. A poem that promises buried treasure to one lucky adventurer has led to a cutthroat competition and five deaths among treasure-hunters. But Cassie’s client doesn’t want the treasure. Instead, he claims to be the one who hid the gold and wrote the poem. And he’s hired Cassie to try to find him. Between the two cases, Cassie has her hands full.</p> <p>In Montana, a killer view can mean more than just the scenery, and Cassie knows much darker things hide behind the picturesque landscape of Big Sky Country. <i>Treasure State</i>, C. J. Box's highly anticipated follow-up to <i>The Bitterroots</i>, is full of more twists and turns than the switchbacks through the Anaconda Range.</p>";
