To preempt the attack, they need him to fly to Europe and stop it at its source—using any means necessary.</p> <p>Troy finds himself partnered with an Interpol agent who is as different from him as can be, and their instant dislike is mutual. But they have an attack to stop and only a few days to do it, and together they’ll need each other as they crisscross Europe in a high-octane cat-and-mouse chase to shut these terrorists down.</p> <p>But what starts off as a straightforward mission (and an opportunity to clear his name) soon catapults Troy headfirst into a global conspiracy. These criminals are more sophisticated than they appear, and even with Troy’s unparalleled military skills, he and his team find themselves constantly one stop behind. With the fate of New York City on the line, the stakes couldn’t be higher.</p> <p>Where will they strike? And when? And can Troy stop it before it’s too late?</p> <p>An unputdownable action thriller with heart-pounding suspense and unforeseen twists, <i>Rogue Force </i>is the debut novel in an exhilarating new series by a number-one best-selling author that will have you fall in love with a brand-new action hero—and listen late into the night.</p>";
