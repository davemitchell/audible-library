Every lead points to a single obvious suspect, but is the evidence too perfect? </p> <p>Risking his friendship with Gail, the respect of his peers, and his own life, Lieutenant Gunther keeps digging, hoping to find out if the man they have in jail is rightly there or if the evidence against him is tainted - what police call \"fruits of the poisonous tree\". </p>";
