window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>#1 </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author Nelson DeMille returns with a “genuinely thrilling” (</b><b><i>The New York Times</i></b><b>) suspense novel featuring his most popular character, former NYPD homicide detective John Corey, called out of retirement to investigate a string of grisly murders—inspired by the actual Gilgo Beach murders. </b><br> <br> In his #1 <i>New York Times </i>bestseller <i>Plum Island</i>, Nelson DeMille introduced listeners to NYPD Homicide Detective John Corey, who we first met on the back porch of his uncle’s waterfront mansion on Long Island, recovering from wounds incurred in the line of duty.<br> <br> Six novels later, <i>The Maze</i> finds Corey on the same porch, having survived new law enforcement roles and romantic relationships—wiser and more sarcastic than ever. Corey is restless and looking for action, so when his former lover Detective Beth Penrose appears with a job offer, Corey has to once again make some decisions about his career—and about reuniting with Beth.<br> <br> Inspired by the real-life Gilgo Beach murders, <i>The Maze</i> takes us on a dangerous hunt for an apparent serial killer who has murdered nine—and maybe more—sex workers and hidden their bodies in the thick undergrowth on a lonely stretch of beach.<br> <br> As Corey digs deeper into this case, he comes to suspect that the failure of the local police to solve this sensational mystery may not be a result of their incompetence—it may be something else. Something more sinister.<br> <br> Featuring John Corey’s politically incorrect humor and brilliant, unorthodox investigative skills, <i>The Maze </i>“finally gives DeMille’s listeners the John Corey fix they’ve been craving,” along with the shocking plot twists that are the trademark of the bestselling author Nelson DeMille, “the master of smart, entertaining suspense” (<i>Bookreporter</i>).</p>";
