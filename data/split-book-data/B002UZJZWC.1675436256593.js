window.bookSummaryJSON = "<i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Stuart Woods returns with another absorbing thriller. <p> President Will Lee is having a rough week. His vice president just died during surgery. Confirmation hearings for the new vice president are under way, but the squeaky-clean governor whom Will has nominated may have a few previously unnoticed skeletons in his closet. And Teddy Fay, the rogue CIA agent last seen in <i>Shoot Him If He Runs</i>, is plotting his revenge on CIA director Kate Rule Lee - the president's wife.</p> <p>Plus there are some loose nukes in Pakistan that might just trigger World War III if Will's diplomatic efforts fall short. It's up to President Lee - with some help from Holly Barker, Lance Cabot, and a few other Stuart Woods series regulars - to save the world, and the upcoming election.</p>";
