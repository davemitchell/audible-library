window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>\"A soft breeze fluttered the white, blue, and red Russian flag in front of the U.N. mission. I remember when the Soviet hammer and sickle flew there. I kind of miss the Cold War. But I think it's back.\"</i> </p> <p>Radiant Angel </p> <p>After a showdown with the notorious Yemeni terrorist known as The Panther, John Corey has left the Anti-Terrorist Task Force and returned home to New York City, taking a job with the Diplomatic Surveillance Group. Although Corey's new assignment with the DSG - surveilling Russian diplomats working at the UN Mission - is thought to be \"a quiet end\", he is more than happy to be out from under the thumb of the FBI and free from the bureaucracy of office life. </p> <p>But Corey realizes something the US government doesn't: the all-too-real threat of a newly resurgent Russia. </p> <p>When Vasily Petrov, a colonel in the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service posing as a diplomat with the Russian UN Mission, mysteriously disappears from a Russian oligarch's party in Southampton, it's up to Corey to track him down. What are the Russians up to and why? Will Corey find Petrov and put a stop to whatever he has planned before it's too late? Or will Corey finally be outrun and outsmarted, with America facing the prospect of a crippling attack unlike anything it's ever seen before? </p> <p>Prescient and chilling. DeMille's new novel takes us into the heart of a new Cold War with a clock-ticking plot that has Manhattan in its crosshairs.</p>";
