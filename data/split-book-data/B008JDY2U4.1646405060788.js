window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Mark Sullivan, the co-author of James Patterson’s <i>Private Games</i>, has, in Robin Monarch, created a compelling new hero. Monarch is a world-class thief and a highly skilled operative - a man with skills, a rigid code of honor, powerful friends, and implacable enemies. </p> <p> In <i>The Art of Rendition</i>, Monarch is an agent for the CIA, called upon to use his unique skills to kidnap and interrogate a Russian nuclear scientist suspected of selling technology to the Iranians. But that’s only part of the challenge - one that many trained agents could handle effectively. They’ve called upon Monarch because, after the interrogation, he must return the scientist without the Russians, the Iranians, or the scientist himself ever knowing he's been grabbed. </p> <p>Meet Robin Monarch in <i>The Art of Rendition</i>, a thrilling, compelling story which showcases the author and character, each at the top of their form. As a bonus, included is a special excerpt from <i>Rogue</i>, the first Robin Monarch novel, coming in Fall of 2012.</p>";
