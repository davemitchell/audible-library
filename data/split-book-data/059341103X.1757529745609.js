window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the modern master of noir comes a novel based on the real-life Hollywood fixer Freddy Otash, the malevolent monarch of the 1950s LA underground, and his Tinseltown tabloid </b><b><i>Confidential </i></b><b>magazine.</b></p> <p>Freddy Otash was the man in the know and the man <i>to</i> know in '50s LA. He was a rogue cop, a sleazoid private eye, a shakedown artist, a pimp - and, most notably, the head strong-arm goon for <i>Confidential</i> magazine. </p> <p><i>Confidential</i> presaged the idiot internet - and delivered the dirt, the dish, the insidious ink, and the scurrilous skank. It mauled misanthropic movie stars, sex-soiled socialites, and putzo politicians. Mattress Jack Kennedy, James Dean, Montgomery Clift, Burt Lancaster, Liz Taylor, Rock Hudson - Frantic Freddy outed them all. He was the Tattle Tyrant who held Hollywood hostage, and now he’s here to <i>CONFESS</i>.</p> <p>“I’m consumed with candor and wracked with recollection. I’m revitalized and resurgent. My <i>meshugenah </i>march down memory lane begins <i>NOW</i>.”</p> <p>In Freddy’s viciously entertaining voice, <i>Widespread Panic </i>torches 1950s Hollywood to the ground. It’s a blazing revelation of coruscating corruption, pervasive paranoia, and of sin and redemption with nothing in between.</p> <p>Here is James Ellroy in savage quintessence. Freddy Otash confesses - and <i>you</i> are here to read and succumb.</p>";
