window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Master storyteller and satirist Kurt Vonnegut was one of the most in-demand commencement speakers of his time. For each occasion, Vonnegutâ€™s words were unfailingly unique, insightful, and witty, and they stayed with audience members long after graduation. </p> <p>As edited by Dan Wakefield, this book reads like a narrative in the unique voice that made Vonnegut a hero to readers and listeners of all ages. At times hilarious, razor-sharp, freewheeling, and deeply serious, these reflections are ideal for anyone undergoing what Vonnegut would call their \"long-delayed puberty ceremony\" - marking the passage from student to full-time adult. </p> <p>This book makes the perfect gift for high school or college graduates - or for parents and grandparents who remember Vonnegut fondly and want to connect with him in a new context.</p>";
