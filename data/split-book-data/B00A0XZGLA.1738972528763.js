window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Jonathan Maberry presents a quirky collection of five stories starring a whole cast of the ever-popular undead. Here you will find a semi-sequel to <i>Dead of Night</i> in which four Army reservists are assigned to hold a small rural bridge during the early days of the zombie apocalypse; a comedic story involving a couple of idiot moonshiners, a comet, gangsters, zombies, and the Great Chicago Fire; a downbeat psychological drama set in the bleak wastelands a few years after the zombie apocalypse; and more - including a story written exclusively for Blackstone. </p> <p>Jonathan Maberry is a <i>New York Times</i> best-selling and multiple Bram Stoker Award-winning author.</p>";
