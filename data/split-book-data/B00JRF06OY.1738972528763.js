window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In this scorching, mournful, often explicit, and never less than moving literary novel by the famed creator of the Easy Rawlins series, Debbie Dare, a black porn queen, has to come to terms with her sordid life in the adult entertainment industry after her tomcatting husband dies in a hot tub. Electrocuted. With another woman in there with him. Debbie decides she just isn't going to \"do it anymore\". But executing her exit strategy from the porn world is a wrenching and far from simple process. </p> <p>Millions of men (and no doubt many women) have watched famed black porn queen Debbie Dare - she of the blond wig and blue contacts - \"do it\" on television and computer screens every which way with every combination of partners the mind of man can imagine. But one day an unexpected and thunderous on-set orgasm catches Debbie unawares, and when she returns to the mansion she shares with her husband, insatiable former porn star and \"film producer\" Theon Pinkney, she discovers that he's died in a case of hot tub electrocution, \"auditioning\" an aspiring \"starlet\". Burdened with massive debts that her husband incurred, and which various L.A. heavies want to collect on, Debbie must reckon with a life spent in the peculiar subculture of the pornography industry and her estrangement from her family and the child she had to give up. She's done with porn, but her options for what might come next include the possibility of suicide. <i>Debbie...</i> is a portrait of a ransacked but resilient soul in search of salvation and a cure for grief.</p>";
