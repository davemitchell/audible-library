But when her mother's undead body is returned to her doorstep from the grave and Gutsy witnesses a pack of ravagers digging up Los Muertos - her mother's name for the undead - she realizes that life finds you no matter how hard you try to hide from it.&nbsp;</p> <p>Meanwhile, Benny Imura and his gang set out on a journey to finish what Captain Joe Ledger started: They're going to find a cure.
