window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the internationally best-selling author of </b><b><i>Fatherland</i></b><b> and the Cicero Trilogy - a chilling and dark new thriller unlike anything Robert Harris has done before.</b></p> <p>1468. A young priest, Christopher Fairfax, arrives in a remote Exmoor village to conduct the funeral of his predecessor. The land around is strewn with ancient artifacts - coins, fragments of glass, human bones - which the old parson used to collect. Did his obsession with the past lead to his death?</p> <p>Fairfax becomes determined to discover the truth. Over the course of the next six days, everything he believes - about himself, his faith, and the history of his world - will be tested to destruction.</p>";
