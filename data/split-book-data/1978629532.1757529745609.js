But after a brilliant and brutal escape, the criminal mastermind begins a killing spree that is intensely personal - one by one, victims fall prey to a twisted and chilling re-enactment of his own depraved past.</p> <p>Jade Marlow is an ex-FBI profiler and tracker whose fearlessness is only surpassed by the severity of his own inner demons. With a record of irrational behavior and a genius for putting himself into the mind of a criminal predator, he may be the one man diabolical enough to catch Atlasia. In an escalating contest of wills and wits, two equally defiant men race toward a showdown where daring is deadly and failure is fatal.</p>";
