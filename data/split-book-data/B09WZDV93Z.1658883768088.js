window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>What has drawn millions of people to Dick Francis’ bestselling equestrian mysteries—aside from the fascinating racetrack setting, exceptionally plotted mystery, and high level of suspense—is the classic Francis hero. Ordinary men of character and scruples, they stand alone in the world of mystery heroes—enduring and persevering with endless reserves of intelligence and courage. In Dead Cert, Francis pits amateur jockey Alan York against a well-organized criminal network as complex as the Mafia.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>The victory was hollow for Alan. He had been running a close second behind his good friend Bill Davidson, when Bill’s horse unexpectedly jerked as he soared over the steeplechase fence. Now, Bill was dead from his injuries, and Alan knew it wasn’t an accident. A small menacing thread of wire dangled from the top of the fence—a carefully constructed plot of malice. Curious, Alan begins an investigation that points to corruption that transcends the racing circuit—seeping into the town surrounding the track. Soon he discovers that knowing too much can be as deadly as not knowing what’s over the next fence.</p>";
