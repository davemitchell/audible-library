Featuring iconic crime-fighting and jet-setting leads, the plots are masterfully conceived and wonderfully escapist.&nbsp;</p> <p>What many listeners don’t know is that Woods' very own life was filled with similar stories of adventure. Born in Georgia, Woods worked in advertising in New York, served in the US Air Force, and had a short stint as an advance man. At the age of 37, he found himself in a transatlantic sailing race, and pursued writing as a full-time career shortly thereafter. Along the way, Woods has lived all over the world, from New York to London, Santa Fe to Ireland. Incorporating his iconic sailing memoir <i>Blue Water, Green Skipper, </i>this is the story of a life well-lived, and a special inside look into the beloved author’s many exploits.</p>";
