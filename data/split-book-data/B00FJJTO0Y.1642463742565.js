window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>On Combat</i> looks at what happens to the human body under the stresses of deadly battle and the impact on the nervous system, heart, breathing, visual and auditory perception, memory - then discusses new research findings as to what measure warriors can take to prevent such debilitations, so they can stay in the fight, survive, and win. A brief but insightful look at history shows the evolution of combat, the development of the physical and psychological leverage that enables humans to kill other humans, followed by an objective examination of domestic violence in America. The authors reveal the nature of the warrior, brave men and women who train their minds and bodies to go to that place from which others flee. </p> <p>After examining the incredible impact of a few true warriors in battle, <i>On Combat</i> presents new and exciting research as to how to train the mind to become inoculated to stress, fear, and even pain. Expanding on Lt. Col. Grossman's popular \"bulletproof mind\" presentation, the audiobook explores what really happens to the warrior after the battle, and shows how emotions, such as relief and self-blame, are natural and healthy ways to feel about having survived combat. A fresh and highly informative look at post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD) details how to prevent it, how to survive it should it happen, how to come out of it stronger, and how to help others who are experiencing it. </p> <p><i>On Combat</i> is easy to understand and powerful in scope. It is a true classic that will be listened to by new and veteran warriors for years to come. </p>";
