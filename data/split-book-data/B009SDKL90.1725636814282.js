window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In a case that spans 20 years, Harry Bosch links the bullet from a recent crime to a file from 1992, the killing of a young female photographer during the L.A. riots. Harry originally investigated the murder, but it was then handed off to the Riot Crimes Task Force and never solved. </p> <p>Now Bosch's ballistics match indicates that her death was not random violence, but something more personal, and connected to a deeper intrigue. Like an investigator combing through the wreckage after a plane crash, Bosch searches for the \"black box\", the one piece of evidence that will pull the case together. </p> <p>Riveting and relentlessly paced, <i>The Black Box</i> leads Harry Bosch, \"one of the greats of crime fiction\" (<i>New York Daily News</i>), into one of his most fraught and perilous cases.</p>";
