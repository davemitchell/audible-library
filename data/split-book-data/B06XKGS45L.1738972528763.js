window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Do you wish you could decode people? Do you want a formula for charisma? Do you want to know exactly what to say to your boss, your date, or your networking partner? You need to know how people work.</p> <p>As a human behavior investigator, Vanessa Van Edwards studies the hidden forces that drive our behavior patterns in her lab—and she's cracked the code. In <i>Captivate</i> she shares a wealth of valuable shortcuts, systems, and behavior hacks for taking charge of interactions at work, at home, and in any social situation. These aren't the people skills you learned in school. This is the first comprehensive, science-backed, real-life manual on human behavior and a completely new approach to building connections.</p> <p>Just like knowing the right formulas to use in chemistry or the right programming language to write code, the hacks in this book are simple ways to solve for people. For example:</p> <p>The Social Game Plan: every party, networking event, and social situation has a predictable map—discover how to work a room and the sweet spot for making the most connections.</p> <p>The Seven Microexpressions: learn how to speed-read the seven universal facial expressions and how they can be used to predict people's emotions.</p> <p>Conversation Sparks: all conversations can be hacked—if you know how certain words generate dopamine in the people you meet.</p> <p>When you understand the laws of human behavior, you can get along with anyone, and your influence, impact, and income will increase as a result. What's more, you will improve your interpersonal intelligence, make a killer first impression, and build rapport quickly and authentically in any situation—negotiations, interviews, parties, and pitches. You will never interact in the same way again.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
