window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>More than 40 years after their release from the notorious \"Hanoi Hilton\", three American prisoners of war return to Vietnam to make peace with their most brutal former captor, a guard whom they've dubbed \"Mr. Wonderful\". The US State Department hopes reconciliation will help cement a major trade agreement between Washington and the Vietnamese. But when Mr. Wonderful is found murdered, the three ex-POWs are accused of the crime, and the multibillion-dollar deal threatens to unravel. Enter pilot, still-aspiring Buddhist, and former military assassin Cordell Logan. </p> <p>Working with a newly formed covert intelligence unit that answers directly to the White House, Logan is dispatched to Hanoi to identify the real killer as the trade agreement threatens to implode. What he soon uncovers proves to be a vexing and increasingly dangerous mystery. Who really killed the guard and why? Unlocking the answers will test every ounce of Logan's ingenuity and resolve while risking his life as never before. </p> <p>Like its three predecessors in the Cordell Logan mystery series, <i>Flat Spin</i>, <i>Fangs Out</i>, and <i>Voodoo Ridge</i>, <i>The Three-Nine Line</i> is a classic, pulse-pounding pause resister. Legions of loyal listeners and critics alike have hailed the humor and full-throttle pacing. <i>The Three-Nine Line</i> may well be the best yet. </p>";
