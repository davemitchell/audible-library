window.bookSummaryJSON = "<i>Fleet of Worlds</i> marks Larry Niven's first full novel-length collaboration within his Known Space universe, the playground he created for his best-selling Ringworld series. Teaming up with fellow SF writer Edward M. Lerner, <i>Fleet of Worlds</i> takes a closer look at Human-Puppeteer (Citizen) relations and the events leading up to Niven's first Ringworld novel. <p>Kirsten Quinn-Kovacks is among the best and brightest of her people. She gratefully serves the gentle race that rescued her ancestors from a dying starship, gave them a world, and nurtures them still. If only the Citizens knew where Kirsten's people came from.</p> <p>A chain reaction of supernovae at the galaxy's core has unleashed a wave of lethal radiation that will sterilize the galaxy. The Citizens flee, taking their planets, the Fleet of Worlds, with them.</p> <p>Someone must scout ahead, and Kirsten and her crew eagerly volunteer. Under the guiding eye of Nessus, their Citizen mentor, they explore for any possible dangers in the Fleet's path - and uncover long-hidden truths that will shake the foundations of worlds.</p>";
