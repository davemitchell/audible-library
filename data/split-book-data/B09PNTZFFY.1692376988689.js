window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The gripping new Jack Reacher thriller from the #1 </b><b><i>New York Times </i></b><b>bestselling authors Lee Child and Andrew Child</b></p> <p><b>“</b><b><i>No Plan B</i></b><b> is not to be missed. A perfectly plotted, fast-paced thriller, with bigger twists than ever before. It’s no wonder Jack Reacher is everyone’s favorite rebel hero.”—Karin Slaughter</b></p> <p><b>ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR: </b><b><i>Reader’s Digest</i></b></p> <p>In Gerrardsville, Colorado, a woman dies under the wheels of a moving bus. The death is ruled a suicide. But Jack Reacher saw what really happened: A man in a gray hoodie and jeans, moving stealthily, pushed the victim to her demise—before swiftly grabbing the dead woman’s purse and strolling away.</p> <p>When another homicide is ruled an accident, Reacher knows this is no coincidence. With a killer on the loose, Reacher has no time to waste to track down those responsible.</p> <p>But Reacher is unaware that these crimes are part of something much larger and more far-reaching: an arsonist out for revenge, a foster kid on&nbsp;the&nbsp;run,&nbsp;a cabal of powerful people involved in a secret conspiracy with many moving parts. There is no room for error, but they make a grave one. They don’t consider Reacher a threat. <i>“There’s too much at stake to start running from shadows.”</i> But Reacher isn’t a shadow.&nbsp;He is flesh and blood.&nbsp;And relentless when it comes to making things right.</p> <p>For when the threat is Reacher, there is <i>No Plan B.</i></p>";
