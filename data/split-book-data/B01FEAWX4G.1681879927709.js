window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When a mysterious new weapon tips the balance against American and allied forces throughout the Middle East, the only person the president can call for help is the man the administration has just fired: Navy SEAL turned covert Homeland Security operative, Scot Harvath. </p> <p>Caught live on Al Jazeera in an off-the-books operation, Harvath is forced to go to ground, as a senator with presidential aspirations turns her sights on the White House and forces President Jack Rutledge to publicly end the career of America's number-one counter-terrorism operative. </p> <p>But when the tide in the war against terror suddenly turns against the West, the president has no choice but to bring Harvath back inside. Ducking a congressional subpoena, Harvath travels to Cyprus where he learns about a weapon called The Sword of Allah, which terrorists intend to use to rid all Muslim lands of Western infidels. As the layers of truth unfold, Harvath is witness to realities more menacing than he ever could have imagined and must rely solely on his instincts to confront a new evil closing in on the United States. </p> <p>With his characteristic precision in describing military technology, high-voltage action, and sweeping international sensibility, Brad Thor has created another supercharged novel that is sure to thrill. </p>";
