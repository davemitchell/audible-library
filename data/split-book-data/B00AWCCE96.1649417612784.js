window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Repairman Jack, F. Paul Wilson’s vigilante hero first seen in the <i>New York Times</i> best seller <i>The Tomb,</i> returns in a thriller that thrusts Jack back into the weird, supernatural world that he thrives in. Looking for clues to the mysterious disappearance of leading conspiracy theorist Melanie Ehler, Jack attends a convention of bizarre and avid conspiracy theorists. It’s a place where aliens are real, the government is out to get you, and the world is hurtling toward an inevitable war of good versus evil incarnate. </p> <p>Jack finds that nobody can be trusted - and that few people are what they seem. Worse yet, Jack’s been having vivid dreams that make him wonder whether he’s headed for a clash with his own past - maybe The Tomb’s evil rakoshi beasts aren’t through with him quite yet.</p>";
