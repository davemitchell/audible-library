Benny, Nix, Lilah, and Chong journey through a fierce wilderness that was once America, searching for the jet they saw in the skies months ago. If that jet exists, then humanity itself must have survived somewhere. </p> <p>Finding it is their best hope for having a future and a life worth living.But the Ruin is far more dangerous than any of them can imagine. Fierce animals hunt them. They come face to face with a death cult. And then there' s the zombies - swarms of them coming from the east, devouring everything in their paths. And these zoms are different. </p> <p>Faster, smarter, and infinitely more dangerous.

One thing Benny and his companions can' t afford to forget: In the great Rot &amp; Ruin, everything wants to kill you. </p>";
