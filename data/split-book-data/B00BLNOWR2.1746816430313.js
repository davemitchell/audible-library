Now one of those secrets is about to come alive - with a vengeance. </p> <p>While trying to solve one of Florida's most profound secrets, Doc Ford is the target of a murder attempt by someone who wants to make it look like an accident. Or is the target actually Tomlinson? Whatever the answer, the liveaboards and fishing guides at Dinkin's Bay on Sanibel Island are becoming increasingly nervous - and wary - after a near-poisoning, a plane crash, and an explosion make it apparent that Ford and Tomlinson are dangerous companions. </p> <p>What their small family of friends donâ€™t know is that their secret pasts make it impossible for the two of them to go to the law for help. There is an assassin on the loose, and it is up to them to find the killer - before he (or she) finishes the job.</p>";
