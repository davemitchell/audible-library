window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Audie Award Finalist, Business/Educational, 2014</b></p> <p>As Alexis Ohanian learned when he helped to co-found the immensely popular reddit.com, the Internet is the most powerful and democratic tool for disseminating information in human history. And when that power is harnessed to create new communities, technologies, businesses, or charities, the results can be absolutely stunning. </p> <p>In this audiobook, Alexis will share his ideas, tips, and even his own doodles about harnessing the power of the Web for good, and along the way, he will share his philosophy with young entrepreneurs all over the globe. </p> <p>At 29, Ohanian has come to personify the dorm-room tech entrepreneur, changing the world without asking permission. Within a couple of years of graduating from the University of Virginia, Ohanian did just that, selling reddit for millions of dollars. He's gone on to start many other companies, like hipmunk and breadpig, all while representing Y Combinator and investing in over 60 other tech startups. <i>Without Their Permission</i> is his personal guidebook as to how other aspiring entrepreneurs can follow in his footsteps. </p>";
