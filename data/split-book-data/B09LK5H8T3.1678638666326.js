window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A novel inspired by number one </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author Mark Greaney’s Audible Original drama, </b><b><i>Armored</i></b><b>.</b></p> <p>Joshua Duffy is a Close Protection Agent—a professional bodyguard— and he's one of the world's elite operatives. That is, he <i>was </i>until his last mission in Lebanon. Against all odds, Josh got his primary out alive, but the cost was high. Josh lost his lower left leg.&nbsp;</p> <p>There's not much call for an elite bodyguard with such an injury. So, Josh has to support his family working as a mall cop in New Jersey. For a man like Josh, this is purgatory on earth, but miracles can occur even in Paramus.&nbsp;</p> <p>A lucky run-in with an old comrade promises to get Josh back in the field for one last job. The UN is sending a peace mission into the Sierra Madre mountains in Mexico, an area so dangerous it's known as <i>Espinazo del Diablo—</i>the Devil's Spine. Only a fool would think they could broker peace between the homicidal drug cartels in the region, and only a madman would sign on to keep those fools alive.</p>";
