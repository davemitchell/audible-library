window.bookSummaryJSON = "Santa Fe lawyer Ed Eagle fell in love with the seductive Barbara Kennerly, and married her, against his better judgment. <p> He should have listened to his intuition. Ed awakens on the morning after his 40th birthday to find that Barbara has vanished, and Ed's money from his business, his bank, and his brokerage accounts has been wired to the Cayman Islands. Barbara, it appears, drugged his birthday wine, neatly cleaned him out, and then fled to Mexico, from where she can't be extradited. And as if that weren't bad enough, when Ed arrives at work that morning, he discovers he's been assigned a new client who looks like nothing but trouble: Joe Big Bear, a part-time mechanic charged with a triple homicide.</p> <p> Ed hires two slightly shady investigators to search for his wife. But when they track Barbara down in Puerto Vallarta, they discover that Joe Big Bear may also be embroiled in Barbara's plot. Ed soon finds himself caught in a scheme much more far reaching and deadly than anyone could have expected.</p>";
