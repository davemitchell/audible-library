window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A man called Milton walks into town.... </p> <p>On the run from his own demons, John Milton treks through the Michigan wilderness into the town of Truth. He's not looking for trouble, but trouble's looking for him. He finds himself up against a small-town cop who has no idea with whom he is dealing and no idea how dangerous he is. </p> <p>But Milton is double crossed and badly injured. Unarmed and alone, he flees into the remote Porcupine Mountains with a posse on his tail. His enemies thought they could hunt him down. That was a mistake, and, where Milton is concerned, one mistake is all you get. </p> <p>From best-selling author Mark Dawson (the John Milton and Beatrix Rose series), <i>The Sword of God</i> is the fifth in the acclaimed series of thrillers that listeners love. Mark Dawson has worked as a lawyer and currently works in the London film industry. His first books, <i>The Art of Falling Apart</i> and <i>Subpoena Colada</i> have been published in multiple languages.</p>";
