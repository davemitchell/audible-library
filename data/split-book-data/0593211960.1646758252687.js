With the help of his new wife, Maggie, rehabilitation, and sheer force of will, he's walking again, eager to resume his work as a Southern lawman and track down those responsible for his attempted murder. But someone is standing in his way: an interim sheriff, appointed by the newly elected Governor Vardaman, the man who Quinn knows ordered his murder. Vardaman sits at the top of the state's power structure - both legal and criminal - and little does he know, Quinn is still working to take him down.&nbsp;</p> <p>Quinn will enlist the help of his most trusted friends, including Federal Agent Jon Holliday, US Marshal Lillie Virgil, and Nat Wilikins, an undercover agent now working for crime queen Fannie Hathcock. Since Quinn's been gone, the criminal element in North Mississippi has flourished, with queenpin Fannie Hathcock enjoying unbridled freedom.

Even an old friend from Quinn's past, Donnie Varner, is out of jail and up to his own ways.</p> <p>Quinn Colson and company have been planning for years, and now they're finally ready to bust apart a criminal empire running on a rigged system for far too long. This is the Battle of Jericho, the epic showdown that's been years in the making. Eventually, the war will end - for better or worse.&nbsp;</p>";
