window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In this brand-new digitally exclusive novella from Edgar Award finalist Mike Lawson, beloved Washington D.C. troubleshooter Joe DeMarco finds himself face to face with Ella Fields, a cunning, ruthless woman he thought he’d locked up behind bars for good.</b></p> <p>Ella Fields was supposed to serve 14 long years, but thanks to a combination of good behavior on her part and prison over-crowding, she was now free after just five years. Well, not quite free, thanks to parole.</p> <p>If she behaved herself—if she was a model citizen—she would go from being a supervised parolee to a mostly unsupervised one and might eventually be able to live a normal life. A life that might not even be worth living, because she was completely broke and the only skills she had were the ones that had landed her in prison.</p> <p>So, her future looked grim, and she didn’t know what she’d do in the long term.</p> <p>But she did know what she was going to do next.</p> <p>She was going to kill the scumbag responsible ruining her life.</p> <p>She was going to kill Joe DeMarco.</p>";
