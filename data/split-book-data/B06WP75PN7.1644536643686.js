There was nothing he could do about it. And Joe knew that he might be their next target. </p> <p>The Cates family had always been a bad lot.

He's not wondering any longer. Joe knows they're coming after him and his family now. He has his friend Nate by his side, but will that be enough this time? All he can do is prepare...and wait for them to make the first move. </p>";
