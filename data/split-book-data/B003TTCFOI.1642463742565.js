window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Paolo Bacigalupi's debut collection demonstrates the power and reach of the science-fiction short story. Social criticism, political parable, and environmental advocacy lie at the center of Paolo's work. Each of the stories herein is at once a warning and a celebration of the tragic comedy of the human experience.</p> <p>The 11 stories in <i>Pump Six</i> represent the best of Paolo's work, including the Hugo nominee \"Yellow Card Man\", the Nebula-and Hugo-nominated story \"The People of Sand and Slag\", and the Sturgeon Award-winning story \"The Calorie Man\". The title story is original to this collection.</p> <p>With this book, Paolo Bacigalupi takes his place alongside SF short-fiction masters Ted Chiang, Kelly Link and others, as an important young writer that directly and unabashedly tackles today's most important issues.</p>";
