Obsessed with the idea of breaking the law, Raskolnikov resolves to kill an old pawnbroker for her cash.</p> <p>Although the murder and robbery are bungled, Raskolnikov manages to escape without being seen. And with nothing to prove his guilt and a mendacious confessor in police custody, Raskolnikov seems to have committed the perfect crime. But in Fyodor Dostoyevsky’s world of moral transgressions, with its reason and its consequences, Raskolnikov’s plan has a devastating hitch: the feverish delirium of his own conscience.</p> <p>AmazonClassics brings you timeless works from the masters of storytelling. Ideal for anyone who wants to hear a great work for the first time or rediscover an old favorite, these new editions open the door to literature’s most unforgettable characters and beloved worlds.</p> <p><b>Revised edition: Previously published as </b><b><i>Crime and Punishment</i></b><b>, this edition of </b><b><i>Crime and Punishment (AmazonClassics Edition)</i></b><b> includes editorial revisions.</b></p>";
