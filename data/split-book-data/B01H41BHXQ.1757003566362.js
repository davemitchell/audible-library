Another rip-roaring, deeply paranoid thriller about the reasons to fear the future.\" (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>, starred review)</p> <p>Hannah Stander is a consultant for the FBI - a futurist who helps the agency with cases that feature demonstrations of bleeding-edge technology. It's her job to help them identify unforeseen threats: hackers, AIs, genetic modification, anything that in the wrong hands could harm the homeland. </p> <p>Hannah is in an airport, waiting to board a flight home to see her family, when she receives a call from Agent Hollis Copper. \"I've got a cabin full of over a thousand dead bodies,\" he tells her. Whether those bodies are all human, he doesn't say. </p> <p>What Hannah finds is a horrifying murder that points to the impossible - someone weaponizing the natural world in a most unnatural way. Discovering who - and why - will take her on a terrifying chase from the Arizona deserts to the secret island laboratory of a billionaire inventor/philanthropist. Hannah knows there are a million ways the world can end, but she just might be facing one she could never have predicted - a new threat both ancient and cutting-edge that could wipe humanity off the earth. </p>";
