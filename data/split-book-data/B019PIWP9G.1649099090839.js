But her parents have already chosen the man she is going to marry. Meanwhile, Sebastian's rivals, Adrian Sloane and Desmond Mellor, are still plotting to bring him and his chairman, Hakim Bishara, down, so they can take over Farthings. </p> <p>Harry Clifton remains determined to get Anatoly Babakov released from a gulag in Siberia following the international success of his acclaimed book, <i>Uncle Joe</i>.
