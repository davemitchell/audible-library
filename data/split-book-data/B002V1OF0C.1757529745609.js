Few believe the tribe exists, and even fewer suspect its deity can change the course of history.</p> <p>For National Underwater and Marine Agency (NUMA) crew leader Kurt Austin, an investigation into the sudden deaths of rare whales leads him to the Mexican coast. Meanwhile, in South America's lush hills, a specially assigned NUMA crew turns up the white-goddess legend - and a murderous cadre of bio-pirates intent on stealing medicinal secrets worth millions. Soon Austin and his crew realize they're working the opposite ends of the same grand scheme. A California agribusiness tycoon is poised to rise to power by monopolizing the earth's depleted freshwater reserves and dominate the world.</p> <p>Austin has a hunch the mythical tribal goddess may be the key to locating a secret formula that could turn seawater into fresh. But with each step into the bush, he and his NUMA team feel like fish out of water, and they must fight a trail of enemies through a dense jungle of treachery and murder.</p>";
