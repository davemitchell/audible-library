window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>After the bloodbath of&nbsp;<i>Butcher’s Moon,</i> the action-filled blowout Parker adventure, Donald Westlake said, “Richard Stark proved to me that he had a life of his own by simply disappearing. He was gone.” And for nearly 25 years, he stayed away, while readers waited. </p> <p>But nothing bad is truly gone forever, and Parker’s as bad as they come. According to Westlake, one day in 1997, “suddenly, he came back from the dead, with a chalky prison pallor” - and the resulting novel,&nbsp;<i>Comeback,</i> showed that neither Stark nor Parker had lost a single step. Knocking over a highly lucrative religious revival show, Parker reminds us that not all criminals don ski masks - some prefer to hide behind the wings of fallen angels.</p>";
