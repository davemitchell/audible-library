window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>2019 Hudson Booksellers Best of the Year</b></p> <p><b>The serial killer isn’t on trial. He’s on the jury.</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>It’s the murder trial of the century. And Joshua Kane has killed to get the best seat in the house - and to be sure the wrong man goes down for the crime. Because this time, the killer isn’t on trial. He’s on the jury.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>But there’s someone on his tail. Former conman turned criminal-defense attorney Eddie Flynn doesn’t believe his movie-star client killed two people. He suspects the real killer is closer than they think - but who would guess just how close?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Praise for </b><b><i>Thirteen</i></b><b>:</b></p> <p>“A brilliant, twisty, ingeniously constructed puzzle of a book. Steve Cavanagh pulls off an enviable premise with panache.” (Ruth Ware)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>“Outstanding - an intriguing premise, a tense, gripping build-up, and a spectacular climax. This guy is the real deal. Trust me.” (Lee Child)</p> <p>“A dead bang BEAST of a book that expertly combines Cavanagh’s authority on the law with an absolutely great thrill ride. Books this ingenious don’t come along very often.” (Michael Connelly)</p>";
