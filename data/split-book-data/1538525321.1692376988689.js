N. 13, returns in this final book of the intelligently written, scintillating series by best-selling author Gregory Mcdonald.</p> <p>Severely lacking in sleep from a recent bout of marathon investigative work, all Flynn wants is a proper night's rest. Unfortunately, at the early morning summons of his frantic daughter, he's off to the cemetery to rescue her young friend who's in quite a peculiar bind. And as the day progresses, a curious collection of puzzling cases fall into Flynn's lap, each one stranger and more urgent than the last.</p> <p>As Flynn plunges into harm's way in pursuit of the truth, buried secrets and dark motives come to light as he races to solve each crime and bring these seemingly disconnected matters to a full and complete case closed.</p>";
