Every day it seems another overachiever is lost to an apparent suicide. But something far more sinister is lurking beneath the surface.</p> <p>These kids have been under surveillance since birth, monitored and measured by an online service called “Greener Pastures.” It’s here, in Greener Pastures, that billionaires observe and recruit the next generation of talent. The highest test scores, the best grades, and the most niche extracurriculars just might land these teenagers an enticing offer at auction. A couple of billion dollars in exchange for the remainder of your life and intellectual labor sounds like a pretty fair deal—doesn’t it?</p> <p>In a high school only Chuck Palahniuk could imagine, students must choose between the risk of following their dreams and the financial security of a lifetime of servitude to the world’s wealthiest and most elite—but how much of a choice do they truly have? A thrilling tale and a critique of modern society, <i>Shock Induction</i> challenges the illusion of choice and explores the tough choices individuals make in the shadow of power and privilege.</p>";
