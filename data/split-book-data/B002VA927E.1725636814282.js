But a very unpleasant surprise awaits her. </p> <p>Many years earlier, Holly and another female army officer had brought charges against their commanding officer for sexual harassment, attempted rape, and rape. Holly had managed to fight him off, but the other woman, a young lieutenant, had not. The officer in question was acquitted of all charges, and has also left the army - for a job as Orchid Beach's new police chief.</p> <p>Will Holly return to the CIA? Or will she challenge her old nemesis for control of the Orchid Beach Police Department?</p>";
