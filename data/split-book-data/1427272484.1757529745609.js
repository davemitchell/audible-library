Using his attacker's cell phone, he learns that another person, a woman named Danica Ellis, is also being targeted. Dryden arrives just in time to save Danica from the assault team sent after her. But neither of them recognizes the other or has any idea why they are being targeted. The only clue is a heavily redacted, official-looking document given to Danica by her stepfather before he was killed. </p> <p>Dryden immediately recognizes it as a \"scrub file\". A scrub file is a record of what a subject knew before their memories were chemically destroyed. The redacted document refers to witnesses to a secret military site in Ashland, Iowa, in 1989. Both Dryden and Danica Ellis lived in Ashland in 1989, when they were both 12 years old, though neither of them has any memory of the other. </p> <p>Switching back and forth between the present day, when Dryden and Danica try to elude the forces that are after them, and the past in Ashland, Iowa, when both were 12, making a discovery that forever changed their lives, this latest Sam Dryden audiobook proves yet again that Patrick Lee is one of the most original, compelling thriller writers today.</p>";
