window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>“An absolutely first-rate thriller.” - </b><b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b></p> <p>Seattle PD sex-crimes detective Livia Lone knows the monsters she hunts. Sold by her Thai parents along with her little sister, Nason; abused by the men who trafficked them; marooned in America...the only thing that kept Livia alive as a teenager was her determination to find Nason.</p> <p>Livia has never stopped looking. And she copes with her failure to protect her sister by doing everything she can to put predators in prison.</p> <p>Or, when that fails, by putting them in the ground.</p> <p>But when a fresh lead offers new hope of finding Nason and the men who trafficked them both, Livia will have to go beyond just being a cop. Beyond even being a vigilante. She’ll have to relive the horrors of the past. Take on one of the most powerful men in the US government. And uncover a conspiracy of almost unimaginable evil.</p> <p>In every way, it’s an unfair fight. But Livia has two advantages: her unending love for Nason -&nbsp;</p> <p>And a lifelong lust for vengeance.</p>";
