Unfortunately, the road is a bit bumpier than he expected. </p> <p>Liesel is having the worst week of her life, and blames only herself. </p> <p>And Ricky? Well, Ricky doesn't believe in bad weeks. Though he can't claim being stuck in prison is all that great. Convenient for all of them, then, that a mysterious organization comes along asking for their help, and in return promises to reverse their excommunication from the secret world. </p> <p>Of course, nothing good ever comes without strings attached. </p>";
