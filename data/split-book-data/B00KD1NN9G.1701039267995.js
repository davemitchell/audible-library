window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From the coauthor of the number-one <i>New York Times</i> best seller <i>American Sniper</i> comes a heart-pounding military thriller in which the fabled Special Ops unit is activated to stop a group of terrorists from launching \"suitcase\" nukes somewhere in America. </p> <p>When Chechen terrorists manage to smuggle a Cold War-era Russian nuke across the Mexican-American border, the president is forced to reactivate the only unit capable of stopping them: Navy SEAL sniper Gil Shannon and his brash team of SEALs and Delta Force fighters. First introduced in <i>Sniper Elite: One-Way Trip</i>, hailed by <i>Publishers Weekly</i> as a \"meaty thriller\" with \"snappy dialogue and well-timed humor\", Shannon and his team were run out of the military after defying direct orders and instead choosing to save the life of one of their own. In <i>Target America</i>, Gil and his team, many of whom had gone rogue, are reunited as an off-the-books Special Ops unit that must race against the clock to save the country from nuclear destruction. </p> <p>Number-one <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Scott McEwen once again delivers a gripping and fast-paced adventure that illuminates the shadow world of clandestine military operations.</p>";
