Jack's oldest friend has turned, they insist. </p> <p>They leave Jack with a warning: If you hear from Seth Gregory, call us immediately. And do not get involved. </p> <p>But they don't know Jack.

A secret that is driving him to the brink of treachery. </p> <p>Racing against the clock, Jack must unravel the mystery: Who is friend and who is foe? Before it's over, Jack Ryan, Jr., may have to choose between his loyalty to Seth and his loyalty to America. </p>";
