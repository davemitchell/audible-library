window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Hannah Smith returns in the stunning new adventure in the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling series from the author of the Doc Ford novels. </p> <p>A 20-year-old unsolved murder from Florida's pot-hauling days gets Hannah Smith's attention, but so does a more immediate problem. A private museum devoted solely to the state's earliest settlers and pioneers has been announced, and many of Hannah's friends and neighbors in Sulfur Wells are being pressured to make contributions. </p> <p>The problem is, the whole thing is a scam, and when Hannah sets out to uncover whoever's behind it, she discovers that things are even worse than she thought. The museum scam is a front for a real-estate power play, her entire village is in danger of being wiped out - and the forces behind it have no intention of letting anything, or anyone, stand in their way.</p>";
