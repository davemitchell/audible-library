window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An incredible national security secret, more than two decades old. </b></p><b> <p>An intrepid, tireless reporter, seeking the truth. </p></b><p><b>A CIA hunter-killer group, who will stop at nothing to silence the story. </b></p><p>This is the book you've been looking for: a deep, dark conspiracy that should delight those who loved the Jason Bourne movies, as well as fans of authors Vince Flynn, Tom Clancy, and Stephen Hunter. You won't believe what happens when free speech slams into the messy realities of national security. </p><p>Meet Nick Woods, a former Marine Scout Sniper, who used to be one of our country's greatest operatives. </p><p>Meet Allen Green, a ballsy reporter in his fifties, who's desperate to break the biggest story since Watergate. </p><p>When the book begins, Nick is in hiding, using an alias, and believes he'll never be found. Allen is opposed to all violence and believes he will never use a gun against someone. </p><p>Both couldn't be more wrong.... </p><p><i>Sold Out</i> is an epic, fast-paced story that will leave you breathless, waiting to see what happens next. It's also the first book in the spectacular Nick Woods series (fourth book to land in Spring, 2016). </p><p>The Nick Woods series has climbed to the top of the charts on Amazon -- and remained there for more than three years. It's also been picked up by Audible.com for a multi-book, audio deal. </p>";
