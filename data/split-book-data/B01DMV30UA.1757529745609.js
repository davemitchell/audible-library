Up to their necks in an investigation of a bizarre apparent homicide, the two detectives barely keep afloat in murky waters. Events take them from the Florida Keys to Los Angeles and back as a plot emerges that involves not only the dangerous Clare but a furious West Coast mob boss determined to get back what is his at any cost. </p>";
