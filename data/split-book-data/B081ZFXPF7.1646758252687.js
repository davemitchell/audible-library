He also said when a story came along that was right for Jack, he’d write it.</p> <p>The<i> Last Christmas</i> is that story.</p> <p>It’s late December between <i>Ground Zero</i> and <i>Fatal Error</i>, a winter of discontent for Jack who’s perhaps spending too much time hanging at Julio’s. An old contact, Edward Burkes, convinces him to take on a missing-person fix. As usual, nothing is as it seems, and the missing person isn’t exactly a person. In fact, it’s like nothing anyone has ever seen.</p> <p>And in the middle of all this, the mysterious Madame de Medici hires him to safeguard a valuable object. Simple, right?</p> <p>Not even close.</p> <p>Yep, Jack is back and, as usual, weird trouble is on his heels.</p>";
