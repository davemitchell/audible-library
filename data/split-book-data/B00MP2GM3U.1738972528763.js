Beginning with the bullet that's been lodged for years in the victim's spine, they must pull new leads from years-old information, which soon reveal that this shooting may have been anything but random. </p> <p>In this gripping new novel, Michael Connelly shows once again why Harry Bosch is \"one of the greats of crime fiction\" (<i>New York Daily News</i>).</p>";
