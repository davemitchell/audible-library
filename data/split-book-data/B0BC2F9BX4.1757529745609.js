But what no one realizes is that forces are at work that have already decided humanity’s fate. With the clock ticking toward an irrevocable apocalypse, it’s no longer a question of if the world can be saved, but who will be the chosen few that survive.</p> <p><i>The Great Unmaking</i> is the grand conclusion to Brian Nelson’s magisterial trilogy that James Rollins has called “a must-read adventure.”</p>";
