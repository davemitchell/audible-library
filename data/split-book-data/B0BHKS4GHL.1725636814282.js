window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The Taliban want her dead. But first they have to get past Breed.</p> <p>Breed, a Delta Force veteran, is surprised when he is called to meet an old acquaintance—CIA agent Anya Stein. She offers Breed a mission he can't refuse—to rescue an American soldier, Robyn Trainor, held captive in the mountains of Afghanistan.</p> <p>When the mission goes sideways, the Taliban hunt Breed and Robyn over some of the harshest terrain on the planet—thousand-foot cliffs, wailing wind, and freezing nights. It's a landscape from hell, every bit as lethal as the killers chasing them.</p> <p>As the Taliban close in, Breed finds the stakes are higher than he ever dreamed—because Robyn Trainor is not what she seems. She is a player in a greater game. One that ends with an explosive showdown in Washington DC's highest corridors of power.</p> <p>Open Season—the second in the stunning Breed action thriller series. Perfect for fans of Lee Child, Jason Kasper, and Jack Carr.</p>";
