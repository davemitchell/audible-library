window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A resilient young woman must outwit a sadistic psychopath in this pulse-pounding thriller from the author of <i>The Silence of the Lambs</i>, a \"master still at the top of his strange and chilling form\" (<i>Wall Street Journal</i>).&nbsp;</p> <p>Twenty-five million dollars in cartel gold lies hidden beneath a mansion on the Miami Beach waterfront. Ruthless men have tracked it for years. Leading the pack is Hans-Peter Schneider. Driven by unspeakable appetites, he makes a living fleshing out the violent fantasies of other, richer men.&nbsp;</p> <p>Cari Mora, caretaker of the house, has escaped from the violence in her native country. She stays in Miami on a wobbly temporary protected status, subject to the iron whim of ICE. She works at many jobs to survive. Beautiful, marked by war, Cari catches the eye of Hans-Peter as he closes in on the treasure. But Cari Mora has surprising skills, and her will to survive has been tested before.</p> <p>Monsters lurk in the crevices between male desire and female survival. No other writer in the last century has conjured those monsters with more terrifying brilliance than Thomas Harris. <i>Cari Mora</i>, his sixth novel, is the long-awaited return of an American master.</p>";
