window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Based on the highly acclaimed NPR podcast <i>How I Built This with Guy Raz</i>, this book offers priceless insights and inspiration from the world's top entrepreneurs on how to start, launch, and build a successful venture.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Great ideas often come from a simple spark: A soccer player on the New Zealand national team notices all the unused wool his country produces and figures out a way to turn them into shoes (Allbirds). A former Buddhist monk decides the very best way to spread his mindfulness teachings is by launching an app (Headspace). A sandwich cart vendor finds a way to reuse leftover pita bread and turns it into a multimillion-dollar business (Stacy’s Pita Chips).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Award-winning journalist and NPR host Guy Raz has interviewed more than 200 highly successful entrepreneurs to uncover amazing true stories like these. In <i>How I Built This</i>, he shares tips for every entrepreneur's journey: from the early days of formulating your idea, to raising money and recruiting employees, to fending off competitors, to finally paying yourself a real salary. This is a must-listen for anyone who has ever dreamed of starting their own business or wondered how trailblazing entrepreneurs made their own dreams a reality.</p>";
