window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Don Winslow returns to the world of PI Boone Daniels and the Dawn Patrol. Doug is one of the Dawn Patrol regulars. He has a miserable job as an accountant for a payday loan company. He has an unsatisfying marriage to Carli, who looks down on him even though she's only five foot three. He is not exactly a joyful person. He doesn't exude happiness or enthusiasm. But while surfing, Doug is in a state approaching euphoria. He loves it. He's happy. Otherwise...not so much.</p> <p>One September morning, Doug accidentally runs right into another surfer on the beach. There are rules about these things. The other guy should call Doug a jerk, Doug should say, \"my bad\", and they should both paddle back out and move on. Problem is, the other surfer doesn't want to move on. He wants to fight. And for once in his life, Doug wants to fight back.</p>";
