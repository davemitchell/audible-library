window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In a daring, brutal act of terrorism, an explosion rocks and topples the Statue of Liberty. Special Agent Michael Walker of the National Park Service is awakened by his boss with that news and sent to New York as the agent in charge. Not long after he lands, he learns two things: one, that Gina Delgado of the FBI has been placed in charge of the investigation as the lead of the Joint Terrorism Task Force, and two, that threats of a second terrorism attack are already being called in to the media. While barred from the meetings of the Joint Task Force due to his lack of security clearance, Walker finds a young boy among the survivors with a critical piece of information–a video linking the attackers to the assault. </p> <p>As a domestic terrorist group, led by a shadowy figure known only as Jeremiah, begins to unleash their plan of attack against America’s cultural symbols, powerful forces within the government are misdirecting the investigation to further their own agenda. As Walker begins to uncover his own tragic connection to the terrorists, it becomes much more than an investigation to him. It becomes a personal mission to uncover and thwart the terrorists’ next attack, one so substantial that the nation’s own future is at stake. </p> <p>“A tense, edge-of-your-seat nail-biter–Leave No Trace is all that and more. This is a no-holds-barred, white-knuckle thrill ride.”—Karen Dionne</p>";
