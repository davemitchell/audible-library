window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Tracy Crosswhite’s ordinary night patrolling her Seattle beat becomes front page news when she responds to a domestic disturbance call that turns into a hostage crisis.</b></p> <p>In this prequel short story to Robert Dugoni’s #1 Kindle-bestselling novel, <i>My Sister’s Grave</i>, Tracy Crosswhite is a young patrol officer, paying her dues, keeping her head down, and hoping a solid record will get her promoted to detective. While years have passed since the disappearance of Tracy’s sister, the experience has made her one of the city’s most dedicated cops.</p> <p>Reporter Tevia Kushman is shadowing Tracy on a ride-along seeking to follow-up on a recent (and nasty) exposé about the Seattle PD’s treatment of female cops. Young and ambitious, Tevia is hoping for a juicy scoop on the gender politics of the PD, but may get a much bigger story than she bargained for…</p> <p>Neither woman expects a routine-sounding call to turn into something dangerous, until Tracy walks into a domestic dispute and finds herself looking down the barrel of a shot-gun. No stranger to high-pressure situations, Tracy must draw on more than just her academy training and lightning-fast shooting skills to find a way to talk down—or take out—the volatile man holding the gun.</p> <p>Praise for Robert Dugoni:</p> <p>“John Grisham, move over.”—<i>The Seattle Times</i></p> <p>“Dugoni is a superb storyteller, and his courtroom drama shines…this “Grave’’ is one to get lost in.”—<i>The Boston Globe</i> on <i>My Sister’s Grave</i></p> <p>“Combines the best of a police procedural with a legal thriller, and the end result is outstanding . . . Dugoni continues to deliver emotional and gut-wrenching, character-driven suspense stories that will resonate with any fan of the thriller genre.”—<i>Library Journal</i> starred review of <i>My Sister’s Grave</i>, one of <i>LJ</i>’s picks for Best Thriller of 2014</p>";
