window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>He was the perfect sold assassin. </p> <p>Boy Nobody: No name. No past. No remorse. At least until he began to ask questions and challenge his orders - until he fell in love with his target. Now The Program is worried that its valuable soldier has become a liability. </p> <p>Boy Nobody, haunted by the outcome of his last assignment, is given a new mission. A test of sorts. A chance to show his loyalty. </p> <p>His objective: Take out Eugene Moore, the owner of a military training and indoctrination camp for teenagers. One target. Limited time frame. Public place. It sounds simple, but a previous operative couldn't do it. He lost the mission and is presumed dead. Boy Nobody is confident he can finish the job. Quickly. </p> <p>But when things go awry, Boy Nobody finds himself lost in a mission where nothing is as it seems: Not The Program, his allegiances, or the truth. </p> <p>The riveting second book in the Unknown Assassin series by Allen Zadoff delivers heart-pounding action and thought-provoking characters, as well as a new, exotic setting, a new mission, and new secrets to be revealed.</p>";
