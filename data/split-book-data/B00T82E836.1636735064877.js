window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>The first thing you should know about me is that my name is not Carter Blake. That name no more belongs to me than the hotel room I was occupying when the call came in.</i> </p> <p>When Caleb Wardell, the infamous \"Chicago Sniper\", escapes from death row two weeks before his execution, the FBI calls on the services of Carter Blake, a man with certain specialized talents whose skills lie in finding those who don't want to be found - a man to whom Wardell is no stranger. </p> <p>Along with Elaine Banner, an ambitious special agent juggling life as a single mother with her increasingly high-flying career, Blake must track Wardell down as he cuts a swathe across America, apparently killing at random. </p> <p>But Blake and Banner soon find themselves sidelined from the case. And as they try desperately to second-guess a man who kills purely for the thrill of it, they uncover a hornet's nest of lies and corruption. Now Blake must break the rules and go head-to-head with the FBI if he is to stop Wardell and expose a deadly conspiracy that will rock the country. </p> <p>Slick, fast-paced, and assured, <i>The Killing Season</i> is the first novel in the gripping new Carter Blake series.</p>";
