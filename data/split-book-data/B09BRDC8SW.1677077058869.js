The location is known for its opium smugglers, violent separatist movement, and heavy deployment of Chinese secret police.&nbsp;</p> <p>Which is exactly why Rivers’ team of former mercenaries was assembled for this covert operation. They are unilateral, unattributable, and if things go wrong, utterly expendable.&nbsp;</p> <p>As Rivers embarks on his most challenging mission yet, he will stop at nothing to hunt down Samedi…the last target standing between him and a sinister conspiracy with global implications.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>";
