window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A gargantuan, mind-altering comedy about the Pursuit of Happiness in America</b><br> <br> Set in an addicts' halfway house and a tennis academy, and featuring the most endearingly screwed-up family to come along in recent fiction, <i>Infinite Jest</i> explores essential questions about what entertainment is and why it has come to so dominate our lives; about how our desire for entertainment affects our need to connect with other people; and about what the pleasures we choose say about who we are.<br> <br> Equal parts philosophical quest and screwball comedy, <i>Infinite Jest</i> bends every rule of fiction without sacrificing for a moment its own entertainment value. It is an exuberant, uniquely American exploration of the passions that make us human — and one of those rare books that renew the idea of what a novel can do.<br> <br> <b>\"The next step in fiction...Edgy, accurate, and darkly witty...Think Beckett, think Pynchon, think Gaddis. Think.\" </b>—<b>Sven Birkerts,&nbsp;</b><b><i>The Atlantic</i></b></p> <p><b>Please note: When you purchase this title, the accompanying reference material, including endnotes, will be available in your My Library section along with the audio.</b></p>";
