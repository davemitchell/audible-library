There's the sun-worshiping holy man whom Sampson once gave his very own mountain, and the fading actress with sidelines in astrology and S&amp;M. Now, one of Sampson's friends may have arranged his kidnapping. <p>As private eye Lew Archer follows the clues from the canyon sanctuaries of the megarich to jazz joints where you can get beaten up between sets, <i>The Moving Target</i> blends sex, greed, misdirected love, and family hatred into an explosive crime novel.</p>";
