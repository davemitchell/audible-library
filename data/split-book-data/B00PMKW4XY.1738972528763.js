window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When John Connolly burst upon the literary suspense scene in 1999, he was an immediate international sensation. His <i>Every Dead Thing</i> became an instantaneous best-seller in England, and here in America, his writing was greeted with extraordinary accolades. He won the prestigious Shamus Award for Best First Private Eye Novel, and, as the <i>San Francisco Examiner</i> wrote, \"John Connolly's tale is as riveting and chilling as Thomas Harris's <i>The Silence of the Lambs</i> and James Patterson's <i>Kiss the Girls</i>.\" </p> <p>Now, Connolly returns with <i>Dark Hollow</i>, a terrifying and ingenious novel of a murderous spree that reaches back decades into the victims' pasts. Back again is ex-New York Police Detective Charlie \"Bird\" Parker, who has returned to his hometown of Scarborough, Maine, after the vicious killings of his wife and daughter; it is time to leave the bloodstained streets of Manhattan and rebuild his family's house - as well as his own life. But for Bird, returning to his roots means digging through a mountain of terror, as memories of his father's and grandfather's untimely deaths resurface and drive him to join the manhunt for the killer of yet another mother and child. Though the obvious suspect is Billy Purdue, the violent former husband of the murdered young woman, another player lurks in this disturbing drama, someone entangled in the dark hollow of Bird's past. </p> <p>Darkly atmospheric, tense, and imbued with the pause register ferocity that only the finest crime fiction offers, <i>Dark Hollow</i> is a stunning successor to <i>Every Dead Thing,</i> a testament to the burgeoning power of John Connolly to tell stories that thrill, frighten, and haunt the soul.</p>";
