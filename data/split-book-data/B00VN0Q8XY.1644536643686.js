window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The new novel from the best-selling author of <i>Ready Player One</i> </p> <p>It's just another day of high school for Zack Lightman. He's daydreaming through another boring math class, with just one more month to go until graduation and freedom - if he can make it that long without getting suspended again. </p> <p>Then he glances out his classroom window and spots the flying saucer. </p> <p>At first Zack thinks he's going crazy. </p> <p>A minute later he's sure of it. Because the UFO he's staring at is straight out of the videogame he plays every night, a hugely popular online flight simulator called <i>Armada</i> - in which gamers just happen to be protecting the Earth from alien invaders. </p> <p>But what Zack's seeing is all too real. And his skills - as well as those of millions of gamers across the world - are going to be needed to save the Earth from what's about to befall it. </p> <p>Yet even as he and his new comrades scramble to prepare for the alien onslaught, Zack can't help thinking of all the science-fiction books, TV shows, and movies he grew up reading and watching and wonder: Doesn't something about this scenario seem a little too...<i>familiar</i>? </p> <p><i>Armada </i>is at once a rollicking, surprising thriller, a classic coming-of-age adventure, and an alien-invasion tale like nothing you've ever heard before - one whose every minute is infused with author Ernest Cline's trademark pop-culture savvy. </p>";
