window.bookSummaryJSON = "Eccentric and reclusive, Emily Dickinson wrote poetry that reflects the richness of her interior world and the peculiar beauty of her inner vision. During her lifetime, her poetry was considered too unusual to be publishable, but after her death in 1885, Dickinson achieved posthumous recognition as one of the great poetic voices of the 19th century. This collection, read by Alexandra O'Karma, includes commentary and some of Dickinson's letters as well as 75 of her over 900 poems, including such favorites as \"Because I Could Not Stop for Death,\" \"'Hope' Is the Thing with Feathers,\" \"There Is No Frigate like a Book,\" and \"There's a Certain Slant of Light.\"";
