window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>For Jonathan Grave and Gail Bonneville, the Crystal Sands Resort is the perfect getaway - until gunshots shatter the night. Wealthy guests are yanked out of their sleep, herded like animals, forced to submit to their captors' demands. But Jonathan and Gail are no ordinary vacationers. The assassins who invade their bungalow receive a deadly surprise. And two determined, skilled operatives escape into the jungle. Jonathan and Gail are not the only free agents on the island.</p> <p>Cut off from his usual tactical team, with a pair of unlikely allies he can't fully trust, Grave's only hope of reliable back-up is his partner Boxers, who's hundreds of miles - and hours - away. It won't be long before the invaders turn this tropical paradise into the powderkeg that will set off global chaos. Grave may be without weapons, but he's never without resources. Bold action is the only solution. Like the scorpion, Grave must strike fast and hard....</p>";
