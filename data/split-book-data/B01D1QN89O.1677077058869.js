window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>National Book Critics Circle Award winner, Autobiography, 2016. </b></p> <p><b>An illuminating debut memoir of a woman in science; a moving portrait of a longtime collaboration, in work and in life; and a stunningly fresh look at plants that will forever change how you see and think about the natural world.</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>Acclaimed scientist Hope Jahren has built three laboratories in which she's studied trees, flowers, seeds, and soil. Her first book might have been a revelatory treatise on plant life. <i>Lab Girl</i> is that, but it is also so much more. Because in it, Jahren also shares with us her inspiring life story, in prose that takes your breath away.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Lab Girl</i> is a book about work, about love, and about the mountains that can be moved when those two things come together. It is told through Jahren's remarkable stories: about the things she's discovered in her lab as well as how she got there; about her childhood - hours of unfettered play in her father's laboratory; about how she found a sanctuary in science and learned to perform lab work \"with both the heart and the hands\"; about a brilliant and wounded man named Bill, who became her loyal colleague and best friend; about their adventurous, sometimes rogue research trips, which take them from the Midwest all across the United States and over the Atlantic, from the ever-light skies of the North Pole to tropical Hawaii; and about her constant striving to do and be the best she could, never allowing personal or professional obstacles to cloud her dedication to her work.&nbsp;</p> <p>Jahren's probing look at plants, her astonishing tenacity of spirit, and her insights on nature enliven every minute of this book. <i>Lab Girl</i> allows us to see with clear eyes the beautiful, sophisticated mechanisms within every leaf, blade of grass, and flower petal and the power within ourselves to face - with bravery and conviction - life's ultimate challenge: discovering who we are.&nbsp;</p>";
