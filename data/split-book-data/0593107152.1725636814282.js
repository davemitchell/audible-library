window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Virgil Flowers will have to watch his back - and his mouth - as he investigates a college culture war turned deadly in another one of Sandford's \"madly entertaining Virgil Flowers mysteries\" (<i>New York Times Book Review</i>).</p> <p>At the local state university, two feuding departments have faced off on the battleground of science and medicine. Each carries their views to extremes that may seem absurd, but highly educated people of sound mind and good intentions can reasonably disagree, right? </p> <p>Then a renowned and confrontational scholar winds up dead, and Virgil Flowers is brought in to investigate...and as he probes the recent ideological unrest, he soon comes to realize he's dealing with people who, on this one particular issue, are functionally crazy. Among this group of wildly impassioned, diametrically opposed zealots lurks a killer, and it will be up to Virgil to sort the murderer from the mere maniacs. </p>";
