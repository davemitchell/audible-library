window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>2016 Audie Award Finalist for Best Male Narrator</b></p> <p>A masterful, intensely suspenseful novel about a reader whose obsession with a reclusive writer goes far too far - a book about the power of storytelling, starring the same trio of unlikely and winning heroes King introduced in <i>Mr. Mercedes</i>.&nbsp;</p> <p>\"Wake up, genius.\" So begins King's instantly riveting story about a vengeful reader. The genius is John Rothstein, an iconic author who created a famous character, Jimmy Gold, but who hasn't published a book for decades. Morris Bellamy is livid, not just because Rothstein has stopped providing books but because the nonconformist Jimmy Gold has sold out for a career in advertising. Morris kills Rothstein and empties his safe of cash, yes, but the real treasure is a trove of notebooks containing at least one more Gold novel.&nbsp;</p> <p>Morris hides the money and the notebooks, and then he is locked away for another crime. Decades later a boy named Pete Saubers finds the treasure, and now it is Pete and his family that Bill Hodges, Holly Gibney, and Jerome Robinson must rescue from the ever-more deranged and vengeful Morris when he's released from prison after 35 years.&nbsp;</p> <p>Not since <i>Misery</i> has King played with the notion of a reader whose obsession with a writer gets dangerous. <i>Finders Keepers</i> is spectacular, heart-pounding suspense, but it is also King writing about how literature shapes a life - for good, for bad, forever.&nbsp;</p>";
