window.bookSummaryJSON = "Every morning, Boone Daniels is out with the Dawn Patrol: four men and one woman as single-minded about surfing as he is, or nearly. They have real jobs; Boone works as a P.I. just enough to keep himself in fish tacos and in the water. <p>But Boone is also obsessed with the unsolved case of a young girl named Rain who was abducted while he was with the San Diego police. He blames himself, just as almost everyone in the department did, for not being able to save her.</p> <p>Unexpectedly, he finds himself with the chance to make amends, and this new investigation gives him a wilder ride than any he's ever imagined.</p>";
