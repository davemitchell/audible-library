This time he and his team are deployed to Afghanistan, where the Taliban is poised to seize the capital city of Kabul and take over the country for good. </p><p>The Taliban is well led by an impressive spiritual warrior, and, making matters worse, America's political leadership is sick of investing men and resources into a war that's now lasted 15 years. Nick and the nearly 50 members of Shield, Safeguard, and Shelter are sent to somehow find a way to avert the looming threat. Unfortunately for them, they'll soon find out that they're fighting more than just the Taliban. </p>";
