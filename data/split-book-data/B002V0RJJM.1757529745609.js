There is nothing so ugly in all the world as what a fire leaves behind, covered in ashes and smoke and a smell you'll think about every day for the rest of your life. <p>Reluctant investigator Alex McKnight finds himself drawn by friendship into a long drive north. The brother of Alex's longtime Ojibwa friend Vinnie LeBlanc works as a hunting guide, serving the rich clients from downstate.

And there's someone out there who definitely does not want them to make it back alive.</p> <p>At once elegant and enormously suspenseful, Steve Hamilton's <i>Blood Is the Sky</i> heralds his arrival as one of the premier crime writers working today.</p>";
