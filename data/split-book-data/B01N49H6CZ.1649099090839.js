window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The ghosts of a 1925 multiple murder stalk Doc Ford in the electrifying new novel in the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling series.</b> </p> <p>Doc Ford has been involved in many strange cases. This may be one of the strangest. </p> <p>A legendary charter captain and guide named Tootsie Barlow has come to him, muttering about a curse. The members of his extended family have suffered a bizarre series of attacks, and Barlow is convinced it has something to do with a multiple murder in 1925, in which his family had a shameful part. </p> <p>Ford doesn't believe in curses, but as he and his friend Tomlinson begin to investigate, following the trail of the attacks from Key Largo to Tallahassee, they, too, suffer a series of near-fatal mishaps. Is it really a curse? Or just a crime spree? The answer lies in solving a near-hundred-year-old murder and probing the mind of a madman. </p>";
