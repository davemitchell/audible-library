But in the ever-evolving world of shadow warfare, there is no respite for heroes or victims. Russian spymaster Arkady Zhukov, the mind behind the attack on Ember, is at it again - directing false flag operations to destabilize Ukraine and enable Russia to seize control of the Black Sea. </p> <p>The American president designates Arkady and his Zetas a clear and present danger to the United States.
