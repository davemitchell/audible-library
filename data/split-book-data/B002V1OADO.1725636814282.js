Timmy needs to disappear, fast. <p>Only Jane Whitefield, a Native American \"guide\" who specializes in making victims vanish, can lead him to safety. But diverting Jane's attention is Mary Perkins, a desperate woman with S&amp;L fraud in her past. Stalking Mary is a ruthless predator determined to find her---and the fortune she claims she doesn't have.</p> <p> Jane quickly creates a new life for Mary and jumps back on Timmy's case...not knowing that the two are fatefully linked to one calculating killer.</p>";
