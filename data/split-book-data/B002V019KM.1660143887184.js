The love of his life is marrying another man, and his friend Mouse is wanted for the murder of a father of 12. As he's searching for a clue to Christmas Black's whereabouts, two suspicious MPs hire him to find his friend Black on behalf of the U.S. Army.</p> <p> Easy's investigation brings him to a blonde woman, Faith Laneer, whose past is as dark as her beauty is bright.
