window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the author of the number one international best seller <i>The Girl in the Spider's Web</i>, the new book in the Millennium series, which began with Stieg Larsson's <i>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</i>.</b> </p> <p>Lisbeth Salander, the girl with the dragon tattoo, the brilliant hacker, the obstinate outsider, the volatile seeker of justice for herself and others - even she has never been able to uncover the most telling facts of her traumatic childhood, the secrets that might finally fully explain her to herself. Now, when she sees a chance to uncover them once and for all, she enlists the help of Mikael Blomkvist, the editor of the muckraking investigative journal <i>Millennium</i>. And she will let nothing stop her - not the Islamists she enrages by rescuing a young woman from their brutality; not the prison gang leader who passes a death sentence on her; not the deadly reach of her long-lost twin sister, Camilla; and not the people who will do anything to keep buried knowledge of a sinister pseudoscientific experiment known only as <i>The Registry</i>. Once again, Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist, together, are the fierce heart of a thrilling full-tilt novel that takes on some of the most insidious problems facing the world at this very moment. </p>";
