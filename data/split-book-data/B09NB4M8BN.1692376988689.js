window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When the First Lady is kidnapped, a rescue specialist discovers her secrets - and a deadly conspiracy - in a thriller by the <i>New York Times </i>best-selling author.</p> <p>First Lady Anna Darmond's penchant for late night parties in South East DC is a harmless open secret - until she's kidnapped out from under the noses of her Secret Service agents in a bloody gunfight. It's an unthinkable crime that, if revealed, could cause public panic. That's why hostage rescue specialist Jonathan Grave and his team must operate in absolute secrecy.</p> <p>But Grave soon realizes that, extraordinary as it is, the mission is not all it seems. There are shadows in Mrs. Darmond's past, cracks in the presidential marriage - and leaks in the country's critical shields of security. As Grave tracks the missing First Lady through a labyrinth of lies and murder, he confronts a traitor at the highest level of Washington power-and a devastating scheme to bring a nation to its knees.</p>";
