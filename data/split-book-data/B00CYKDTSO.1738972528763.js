Escaping over water made choppy by hot Japanese bullets. Defending a cave full of frightened American nurses from a brutal onslaught of killers. The Rat Bastards fight on, turning New Guinea into an island of savage slaughter. They’ll take on their own top brass, then roll flat the whole Jap army. For them, war isn’t everything. It’s the only thing. </p><p>The Rat Bastards.</p>";
