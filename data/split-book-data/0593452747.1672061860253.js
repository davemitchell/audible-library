A woman is slumped over the wheel.</p> <p>Dead?&nbsp;No, nothing is what it seems.&nbsp;</p> <p>The woman is Michaela Fenton, an army veteran turned FBI agent trying to find her twin brother, who might&nbsp;be mixed up with some dangerous people.&nbsp;Most of them would rather die than betray their terrifying leader, who has burrowed his influence deep into the nearby border town, a backwater that has seen better days.&nbsp;The mysterious Dendoncker rules from the shadows, out of sight and under the radar, keeping his dealings in the dark.</p> <p>He would know the fate of Fenton’s brother.&nbsp;</p> <p>Reacher is good at finding people who don’t want to be found, so he offers to help, despite feeling that Fenton&nbsp;is keeping secrets of her own.&nbsp;But a life&nbsp;hangs in the balance. Maybe more than one.&nbsp;But to bring Dendoncker down will be the riskiest job of Reacher's life.&nbsp;Failure is not an option, because in this kind of game, the loser is always better off dead.</p>";
