window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES </i></b><b>BEST SELLER</b>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>The </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best seller that explains one of the most important perceptual shifts in the history of humankind</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>Scott Adams was one of the earliest public figures to predict Donald Trump’s election. The mainstream media regarded Trump as a lucky clown, but Adams - best known as “the guy who created <i>Dilbert</i>” - recognized a level of persuasion you only see once in a generation. We’re hardwired to respond to emotion, not reason, and Trump knew exactly which emotional buttons to push.&nbsp;</p> <p>The point isn’t whether Trump was right or wrong, good or bad. Adams goes beyond politics to look at persuasion tools that can work in any setting - the same ones Adams saw in Steve Jobs when he invested in Apple decades ago. <i>Win Bigly</i> is a field guide for persuading others in any situation - or resisting the tactics of emotional persuasion when they’re used on you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>This revised edition features a bonus chapter that assesses just how well Adams foresaw the outcomes of Trump’s tactics with North Korea, the NFL protesters, Congress, and more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>";
