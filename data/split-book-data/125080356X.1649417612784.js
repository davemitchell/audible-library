window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author Jonathan Maberry's thrilling </b><b><i>Relentless</i></b><b>, Rogue Team International joins Joe Ledger in a new hunt that spans the globe and journeys deep into the terrifying landscape of the human heart.</b></p> <p>Joe Ledgerâ€™s world has been torn apart. The people closest to him have been savagely murdered, and Ledger is on the hunt for the killers. His already fragile psyche has cracked apart, allowing a dangerous darkness to overwhelm him.</p> <p>His hunt takes him deep into the world of the deadly black-market weapons sales, and standing in his way are a new generation of private military contractors. These mercenaries have been enhanced with cutting-edge cybernetics and chemical enhancements, transforming them into real-world super soldiers. Stronger, faster, harder to hurt, and fitted with built-in weapons. They are beyond anything Joe has ever faced.</p> <p>But he is not the Joe Ledger they expected to fight. He is defined by the Darkness now. The attempt to destroy him - to break him - has backfired. Instead his enemies have turned him into a far more fearsome weapon.</p> <p><b>Everyone is out for blood.</b>&nbsp;</p> <p><b>A Macmillan Audio production from St. Martin's Griffin</b></p>";
