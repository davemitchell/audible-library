window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From multiple Bram Stoker Award-winning author Jonathan Maberry comes a major new thriller that combines the best of the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling books <i>World War Z</i> by Max Brooks and James Rollins’ <i>Sigma Force</i> Series to kick off the start of a new series featuring Joe Ledger and the Department of Military Sciences. </p> <p>When you have to kill the same terrorist twice in one week there’s either something wrong with your world or something wrong with your skills - and there’s nothing wrong with Joe Ledger’s skills. And that’s both a good and a bad thing. It’s good because he’s a Baltimore detective who has just been secretly recruited by the government to lead a new task force created to deal with the problems that Homeland Security can’t handle. This rapid-response group is called the Department of Military Sciences, or the DMS for short. It’s bad because his first mission is to help stop a group of terrorists from releasing a dreadful bioweapon that can turn ordinary people into zombies. The fate of the world hangs in the balance. </p> <p>Jonathan Maberry is the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling and multiple Bram Stoker Award–winning author of <i>Ghost Road Blues</i>, the first of a trilogy of thrillers with a supernatural bite. A professional writer and writing teacher, he has sold more than 1.000 articles, 17 nonfiction books, six novels, and two plays. </p>";
