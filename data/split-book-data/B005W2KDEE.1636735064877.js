window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>In Session</i>, from international best seller M.J. Rose, features the return of Dr. Morgan Snow, in a brand-new story collection! </p> <p>As a therapist specializing in sexual issues, psychiatrist Dr. Morgan Snow isn't easily shocked or shaken, as readers and listeners of the popular \"Butterfield Institute\" novels know. There are times, however, when the need for her services leads her out of the office... and into unfamiliar worlds. </p> <p>In these stories, the therapist matches her wits - and her training - against three men of mystery: Jack Reacher, John Rain, and Cotton Malone. These characters are, of course, familiar to listeners as the creations, respectively, of <i>New York Times</i> best-selling authors Lee Child, Barry Eisler, and Steve Berry. All three swore that their characters would never agree to therapy - unless Rose found a way to get them there. And she did. </p> <p>In \"Extenuating Circumstances\" with Steve Berry's Cotton Malone, a woman seeks help for her lover, and sends Dr. Snow overseas on a most unusual house call. </p> <p>In \"Decisions, Decisions\", Barry Eisler's John Rain forces Dr. Snow out of her own comfort zone, and into the world of a former patient's worst nightmare. </p> <p>And in \"Knowing You're Alive\", with Lee Child's Jack Reacher, there are revelations for both the injured Dr. Snow and her unexpected savior/patient. </p> <p>Note that this book uses the actual narrators from each character's respective series (Phil Gigante/Natalie Ross: Dr. Morgan Snow; Scott Brick: Cotton Malone; Barry Eisler: John Rain; Dick Hill Jack Reacher). </p> <p>All the proceeds of the audiobook and a share of the proceeds of the ebook will be donated to David Baldacci's Wish You Well Foundation, supporting family literacy. (wishyouwellfoundation.org/)</p> <p>These characters are the creations, respectively, of <i>New York Times</i> best-selling authors Lee Child, Barry Eisler, and Steve Berry, and are used with their full knowledge and participation. </p> <p><b>BONUS AUDIO: Audible interviews author M.J. Rose.</b></p>";
