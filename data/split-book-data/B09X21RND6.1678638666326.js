window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Multiple-time </b><b><i>USA Today </i></b><b>and Amazon five-million-copy best-selling authors David Archer and Blake Banner have combined forces to create one hell of a thriller series!</b></p> <p>Why was Dr. Robert Magnusson murdered? More to the point, why was he murdered 500 miles from anywhere, in the frozen wilderness of Greenland?</p> <p>And then there is the question of what he was doing 70 miles north of the UCLA base camp, where he should have been—and what were the instruments he had secretly set up and housed in the shack out there?</p> <p>And then again there is the question of who killed him. Thor Olafson, his colleague and friend, blames the United States’ Presidential Commission on Sustainable Energy because his findings defied the commission’s wishes. Dr. Bernard Monet, another team member, blames the Green Tomorrows Corporation, who partly funded the report. What his girlfriend, Silvia, thinks nobody knows because she has disappeared with all his papers and research.</p> <p>When Alex Mason is sent to Greenland to find answers to these questions, what he finds is something far more harrowing and far-reaching than anyone could have expected. The investigation will take him and Mossad Agent Aila Gallin from DC to Nuuk, to London and the Bahamas–and to the very edge of perdition....</p>";
