Unexpectedly the man takes off running and heads for a deserted warehouse. Jack Noble and his partner, Frank Skinner, believe the man to be part of a terrorist organization that is involved in smuggling drugs, guns, and men into the country. But it turns out their plan involves far more export than import and hits a lot closer to home. As the case unfolds, the man behind it all reaches out to Jack with a simple message...37 hours. </p>";
