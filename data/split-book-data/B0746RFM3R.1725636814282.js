window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Number one <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author</b> <b>John Grisham's newest legal thriller takes you inside a law firm that's on shaky ground.</b> </p> <p>Mark, Todd, and Zola came to law school to change the world, to make it a better place. But now, as third-year students, these close friends realize they have been duped. They all borrowed heavily to attend a third-tier, for-profit law school so mediocre that its graduates rarely pass the bar exam, let alone get good jobs. And when they learn that their school is one of a chain owned by a shady New York hedge-fund operator who also happens to own a bank specializing in student loans, the three know they have been caught up in The Great Law School Scam. </p> <p>But maybe there's a way out. Maybe there's a way to escape their crushing debt, expose the bank and the scam, and make a few bucks in the process. But to do so, they would first have to quit school. And leaving law school a few short months before graduation would be completely crazy, right? Well, yes and no... </p> <p>Pull up a stool, grab a cold one, and get ready to spend some time at <i>The Rooster Bar</i>. </p>";
