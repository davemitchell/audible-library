Members of Congress never get to see it and only the president has the final say over it. Once your name is on the list, it doesn't come off - until you're dead. </p> <p><b>Someone</b> has just added counterterrorism operative Scot Harvath's name to the list. </p> <p><b>Somehow,</b> Harvath must evade the teams dispatched to kill him long enough to untangle who has framed him for treason and why they want him out of the way. </p> <p><b>Somewhere, someone, somehow</b> can put all the pieces together. The only question is: Will Harvath get to that person before the United States comes under the most withering domestic terrorist attack ever conceived?</p>";
