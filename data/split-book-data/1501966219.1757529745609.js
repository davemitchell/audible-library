In this audiobook, his stories carry us from the cozy familiarity of the small-town America we lived in in <i>Dandelion Wine</i> to the frozen desert and double moon that have been parts of our interior landscape since <i>The Martian Chronicles</i>. His characters range from the \"ordinary\" - a rookie cop, an unhappy wife on vacation in Mexico, an old parish priest hearing confession - to the quite extraordinary: the parrot to whom Ernest Hemingway confided the plot of his last, greatest, never-put-down-on-paper novel, and a woman who, in New York City in the summer of 1974, hangs out a sign reading \"Melissa Toad, Witch\". </p> <p>Fantastic or conventional, chillingly suspenseful or hauntingly nostalgic, each of these stories has that aura of the unexpected combined with the special ring of absolute rightness that is brilliantly, uniquely Bradbury.</p>";
