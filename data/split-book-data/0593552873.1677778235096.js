window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Letty Davenport, the brilliant and tenacious adopted daughter of Lucas Davenport, takes the investigative reins in the newest thriller from #1 bestselling author John Sandford.</b></p> <p><b>“Sandford fans rejoice! Davenport next generation has arrived and Letty is exactly the kind of cool-eyed, smart-mouthed, lethally dangerous heroine we’ve been waiting for.”</b> <b>--Lisa Gardner, author of </b><b><i>One Step Too Far</i></b></p> <p>By age twenty-four, Letty Davenport has seen more action and uncovered more secrets than many law enforcement professionals. Now a recent Stanford grad with a master’s in economics, she’s restless and bored in a desk job for U.S. Senator Colles. Letty’s ready to quit, but her skills have impressed Colles, and he offers her a carrot: feet-on-the-ground investigative work, in conjunction with the Department of Homeland Security.&nbsp;</p> <p>Several oil companies in Texas have reported thefts of crude, Colles tells her.&nbsp; He isn’t so much concerned with the oil as he is with the money: who is selling the oil, and what are they doing with the profits? Rumor has it that a fairly ugly militia group might be involved. Colles wants to know if the money is going to them, and if so, what they’re planning.&nbsp;</p> <p>Letty is partnered with a DHS investigator, John Kaiser, and they head to Texas.&nbsp; When the case quicky turns deadly, they know they’re on the track of something bigger.&nbsp; The militia group has set in motion an explosive&nbsp;plan . . . and the clock is ticking down.</p>";
