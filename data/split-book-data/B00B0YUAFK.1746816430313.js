window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>August Busch IV had everything - or seemed to. In 2006, Busch became the chief executive of Anheuser-Busch, the sixth member of his family to control the legendary brewery. At age 42, Busch was handsome, wealthy, married to a beautiful woman, and running one of the biggest companies in America. Two years later, Busch lost control of Anheuser-Busch. Soon he was jobless, divorced, and struggling with alcohol and drugs. Then he woke to find his girlfriend, a waitress named Adrienne Martin, dead in his bed. </p> <p>From prize-winning novelist and former <i>New York Times</i> reporter Alex Berenson, <i>The Prince of Beers</i> is the true story of the secrets, lies, addiction, and family dysfunction behind Martin's death and Busch's shocking downfall.</p>";
