He learns of a writer in Russia whose memoir of life inside Stalin's palace has landed the writer in prison for life, his book taken off shelves and destroyed. Harry becomes obsessed with freeing the writer and telling his story. His wife Emma, meanwhile is the chair of Barringtons Shipping, having escaped a plot to destroy their company by bombing one of their luxury liners, and now the company is thriving. But old villains remain determined in their efforts to bring down both Emma and her family. </p> <p>From Major Alex Fisher to his friend and ally Mrs. Virginia Fenwick, Emma will have to use every tool she has to save them. Their son Sebastian's banking career means everything to him, but is he willing to give up Samantha, the love of his life, in pursuit of his success? Once again, in the hands of our age's most masterful storyteller, the lives of the Clifton family will have listeners mesmerized.</p>";
