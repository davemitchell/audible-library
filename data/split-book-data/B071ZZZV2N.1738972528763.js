Only OMBRA and its battalions around the world seem capable of defending Earth from the next wave of attack - terraforming. But at what price can we gain our freedom? </p> <p>The Crays are pushing the human race to the edge of extinction, and we will have to learn new ways of living to defeat this threat. This is a time for heroes. For killers. For Grunts. Benjamin Carter Mason will question his identity, his beliefs, and his mission as he dives deep into the heart of an alien-transformed Los Angeles. And in the end, he might be the last person on Earth defending not just our lives but our humanity. </p>";
