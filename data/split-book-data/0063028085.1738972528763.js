window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>New York Times </i></b><b>Bestseller</b></p> <p><b>From Neal Stephenson—who coined the term “metaverse” in his 1992 novel </b><b><i>Snow Crash</i></b><b>—comes a sweeping, prescient new thriller that transports listeners to a near-future world in which the greenhouse effect has inexorably resulted in a whirling-dervish troposphere of superstorms, rising sea levels, global flooding, merciless heat waves, and virulent, deadly pandemics.</b></p> <p><b>“Stephenson is one of speculative fiction’s most meticulous architects. . . . </b><b><i>Termination Shock</i></b><b> manages to pull off a rare trick, at once wildly imaginative and grounded.” — </b><b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b></p> <p>One man—visionary billionaire restaurant chain magnate T. R. Schmidt, Ph.D.—has a Big Idea for reversing global warming, a master plan perhaps best described as “elemental.” But will it work? And just as important, what are the consequences for the planet and all of humanity should it be applied?</p> <p>Ranging from the Texas heartland to the Dutch royal palace in the Hague, from the snow-capped peaks of the Himalayas to the sunbaked Chihuahuan Desert, <i>Termination Shock </i>brings together a disparate group of characters from different cultures and continents who grapple with the real-life repercussions of global warming. Ultimately, it asks the question: Might the cure be worse than the disease?</p> <p>Epic in scope while heartbreakingly human in perspective, <i>Termination Shock</i> sounds a clarion alarm, ponders potential solutions and dire risks, and wraps it all together in an exhilarating, witty, mind-expanding speculative adventure.</p>";
