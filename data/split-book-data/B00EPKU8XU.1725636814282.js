window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"Another winner from a top-tier thriller writer.\"</b><b><i> --Kirkus Reviews</i></b></p> <p>Daniel Brasher left a high-paying job as a money manager to marry his community-organizer wife and do the work he loves, leading group counseling sessions with recently paroled ex-cons. Now he's about to start a private practice. But just before his last day on the job, Daniel finds an envelope in his department mailbox - one intended for someone else that was placed in his slot by accident. Inside it is an unsigned piece of paper, a note that says only \"admit what you've done or you will bleed for it.\" along with a midnight deadline…which has passed. And the person to whom the envelope was addressed was found brutally murdered… </p> <p><b>\"A fast-paced roller coaster ride…well-written and extremely realistic.\"</b><b><i> --Criminal Element </i></b></p> <p>Soon, Daniel finds more warnings in his office mail, to people that the police cannot track down, and to victims that cannot be saved. Daniel's efforts, however, have alerted the killer to his involvement… and the next threat he receives is his own. Now, Daniel - with no clue what he's supposed to have done or to what action he must confess - must somehow appease, or outwit, a seemingly unstoppable killer. And time is running out…</p> <p><b>\"Menace, treachery, and intrigue have never been more exciting.\"</b><b><i> --The Washington Post</i></b></p>";
