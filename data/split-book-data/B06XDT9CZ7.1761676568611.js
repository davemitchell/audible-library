He only wants to live in peace with his family and forget the war that nearly killed him.... </p> <p>It's not going to happen. </p> <p>Stephen Hunter's epic national best sellers <i>Point of Impact</i> and <i>Black Light</i> introduced millions to Bob Lee Swagger, called \"Bob the Nailer\", a heroic but flawed Vietnam War veteran forced twice to use his skills as a master sniper to defend his life and his honor. Now, in his grandest, most intensely thrilling adventure yet, Bob the Nailer must face his deadliest foe from Vietnam - and his own demons - to save his wife and daughter. </p> <p>During the latter days of the Vietnam War, deep in-country, a young idealistic marine named Donny Fenn was cut down by a sniper's bullet as he set out on patrol with Swagger, who himself received a grievous wound. Years later Swagger married Donny's widow, Julie, and together they raised their daughter, Nikki, on a ranch in the isolated Sawtooth Mountains in Idaho. Although he struggles with the painful legacy of Vietnam, Swagger's greatest wish - to leave his violent past behind and live quietly with his family - seems to have come true. </p> <p>Then one idyllic day, a man, a woman, and a girl set out from the ranch on horseback. High on a ridge above a mountain pass, a thousand yards distant, a calm, cold-eyed shooter, one of the world's greatest marksmen, peers through a telescopic sight at the three approaching figures. </p> <p>Out of his tortured past, a mortal enemy has once again found Bob the Nailer. <i>Time to Hunt</i> proves anew why so many consider Stephen Hunter to be our best living thriller writer.
