window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The new page-turning Stone Barrington novel from the perennially entertaining <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author. Stone Barrington is enjoying his usual dinner at Elaine's when his boss at Woodman &amp; Weld, the law firm where Stone is \"of counsel,\" walks in, sits down, and hands Stone a check for one million dollars. It seems Stone's undercover dealings with MI6 have brought in a big new client for the firm, and they're willing to pay Stone a huge bonus and make him a partner. But almost as soon as he's taken the deal, Stone gets wind of an impending scandal that might torpedo his big promotion: It may be that the lucrative new client whom he's introduced to the firm might be a Bernie Madoff in disguise...</p>";
