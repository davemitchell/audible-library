window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Pinion, Minnesota: a huge city of all of 700 folks who define the phrase ‘small town’. Nothing has ever happened in Pinion, and nothing ever will...until the mayor of sorts comes up with a scheme to put Pinion on the map. He’s heard of a place where a floating image of the Virgin Mary turned the whole town into a shrine, attracting thousands of curious people and making the townsfolk rich overnight. Why not stage a prank in Pinion and do the same? What could go wrong? </p> <p>And then a dead body shows up. </p> <p>It turns out that lots can go wrong with a get-rich-quick scheme like this one...and lots will. It’ll take everything Virgil Flowers has to put things to right - before someone else dies.</p>";
