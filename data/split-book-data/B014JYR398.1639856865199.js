window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A hit man who only kills other hit men winds up a target himself.</b> </p> <p>Michael Hendricks kills people for money. That aside, he's not so bad a guy. </p> <p>Once a covert operative for a false-flag unit of the US military, Hendricks was presumed dead after a mission in Afghanistan went sideways. He left behind his old life - and beloved fianc√©e - and set out on a path of redemption...or perhaps one of willful self-destruction. </p> <p>Now Hendricks makes his living as a hit man entrepreneur of sorts - he hits only other hit men. For 10 times the price on your head, he'll make sure whoever's coming to kill you winds up in the ground instead. Not a bad way for a guy with his skill set to make a living - but a great way to make himself a target. </p>";
