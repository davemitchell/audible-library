window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A riveting exposé of the inner workings of American power—as gripping as </b><b><i>House of Cards</i></b><b> and as fraught with personal dynamics as </b><b><i>The Diplomat</i></b><b>.</b><br> <br> Valeria Velez has just pulled off a stunning upset in California's 27th District, ousting ten-term corporatist incumbent Fillian Dunne from his seat in Congress. Young, beautiful, and idealistic, Valeria and her boyfriend/campaign manager Preston Jante are determined to use Valeria's new position to \"stop stuffing the maw of the military machine\" and return power to the people. But when fugitive hacker Lance Thaddeus uncovers a top-secret Pentagon program combining artificial intelligence with nuclear command-and-control, Valeria might have to choose between her ideals...and her life.<br> <br> And even while trying to navigate the unfamiliar pathways and temptations of American power, Valeria will have to contend with a mother still frozen by bitterness about the past, a brother jealous of Valeria's future, and the ghost of the father who abandoned them all and then died before Valeria could even begin to understand his reasons.<br> <br> But as Valeria will discover, in the world she has entered, personal and political can be meaningless distinctions. There are no solutions, only trade-offs, and as Valeria negotiates with the factions holding real power in America—Wall Street, the Pentagon, Silicon Valley—the lines between compromise and capitulation, savvy and sell-out, player and played, become increasingly hard to see, with ultimate stakes not just for Valeria, but for the very future of constitutional democracy in America.</p>";
