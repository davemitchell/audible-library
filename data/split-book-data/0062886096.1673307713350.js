In its quest for dominance, China is determined to reclaim Taiwan—a pivotal ally the United States has sworn to protect. Pike learns that the Chinese have a devious plan to bait the island nation into all-out war by destabilizing the government and manipulating an artificial intelligence defense system.&nbsp;</p> <p>As the threat reaches a boiling point, Pike alone realizes that what they’re seeing isn’t actually real.
