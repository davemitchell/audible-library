window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>John Wells returns for another deadly mission from <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Alex Berenson...</p> <p>In an Istanbul hotel, a deep source warns a CIA agent that Iran intends to kill a CIA station chief. Quickly, John Wells is called in to investigate, but before he can get far, the tip comes true. Which means that the next warning the source gives will be taken very seriously indeed. And it’s a big one.</p> <p>A radioactive one.</p> <p>As the threat level jumps and the government mobilizes, Wells must figure out what’s really going on. From a drug lord’s mansion in Guatemala to a secret plastic surgery center in Thailand to the slums of Istanbul, Wells uses every skill he has - including his ability to go undercover in the Arab world - to chase down leads. But the enemy he faces is equally determined. And soon he may be too late to pull the United States back from the brink of war...</p>";
