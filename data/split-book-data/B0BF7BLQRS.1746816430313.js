window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>NEWBERY MEDAL WINNER </b><b><i>•</i></b><b> #1 </b><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES</i></b><b> BESTSELLER<br> <br> An enthralling novel for all ages by award-winning author Dave Eggers, told from the perspective of one uniquely endearing dog.</b><br> <br> <b>“Johannes is a highly engaging narrator whose exuberance and good nature run like a bright thread through the novel’s pages.” —</b><b><i>The New York Times</i></b><br> <br> Johannes, a free dog, lives in an urban park by the sea. His job is to be the Eyes—to see everything that happens within the park and report back to the park’s elders, three ancient Bison. His friends—a seagull, a raccoon, a squirrel, and a pelican—work with him as the Assistant Eyes, observing the humans and other animals who share the park and making sure the Equilibrium is in balance.<br> <br> But changes are afoot. More humans arrive in the park. A new building, containing mysterious and hypnotic rectangles, goes up. And then there are the goats—an actual <i>boatload </i>of goats—who appear, along with a shocking revelation that changes Johannes’s view of the world.<br> <br> This story about friendship, beauty, and liberation (and running very, <i>very </i>fast) will make listeners of all ages see the world around them in a wholly new way.</p>";
