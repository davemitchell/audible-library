As suspicion builds that the doctor may have staged the baby’s disappearance, the relationship between the doctor and his wife and neighbors begins to disintegrate. Stride and his lover, Serena, a former Las Vegas detective, find themselves on opposite sides of the case, with Stride pursuing evidence that incriminates the doctor and Serena trying to prove that the baby really was abducted. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Stride’s partner, Maggie, and a headstrong young cop are tracking a man responsible for a violent crime wave in the rural areas of Duluth.
