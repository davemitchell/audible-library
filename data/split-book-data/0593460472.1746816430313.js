window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"A gripping guide to the modern taming of the infinite.\" (</b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p>Part history, part philosophy, part love letter to the study of mathematics, <i>Everything and More</i> is an illuminating tour of infinity. With his infectious curiosity and trademark verbal pyrotechnics, David Foster Wallace takes us from Aristotle to Newton, Leibniz, Karl Weierstrass, and finally Georg Cantor and his set theory. Through it all, Wallace proves to be an ideal guide - funny, wry, and unfailingly enthusiastic. Featuring an introduction by Neal Stephenson, this edition is a perfect introduction to the beauty of mathematics and the undeniable strangeness of the infinite. </p> <p><b>Includes a downloadable PDF with images from the text.</b> </p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
