window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In his latest bizarre concoction, Dorsey picks up - sort of - various plot strands from his earlier books, including <i>Florida Roadkill, Hammerhead Ranch Motel,</i> and <i>Orange Crush</i>. There's still the matter, you see, of the briefcase full of cash, and still unresolved are the stories of Serge Storms, the serial killer and history buff; Johnny Vegas, the startlingly handsome virgin; Jethro Maddox, the Hemingway look-alike; and Paul, the Passive-Aggressive Private Eye. Fans of Dorsey's magnificently off-kilter adventures will be thrilled to rejoin these characters and to meet a host of new ones, including Mr. Granda, the leader of a down-and-out drug cartel who is looking to buy a submarine, and Ralph Krunkleton, one of America's very worst novelists, whose novel <i>The Stingray Shuffle</i> features prominently in the goings-on. A brilliantly constructed romp that is part thriller, part farce, and entirely, gloriously, deliriously wacky. </p>";
