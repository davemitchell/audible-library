window.bookSummaryJSON = "<i>The Denver Post</i> hails Craig Johnson's Walt Longmire mystery series as a must-read. Joining the four previous novels - all of which have been Book Sense picks - <i>The Dark Horse</i> puts a unique Wyoming twist on the classic British village mystery. <p>Sheriff Longmire investigates when his instincts tell him something isn't right about a prisoner accused of killing her husband. Wade Barsad, a man with a dubious past, locked his wife's horses in their barn and burned the animals alive. In return, Mary shot Wade in the head six times - or so the story goes. Walt doesn't believe Mary's confession, and he's determined to dig deeper. Posing as an insurance claims investigator, Walt soon discovers other people who might have wanted Wade dead, including a beautiful Guatemalan bartender and a rancher with a taste for liquor, but not for honesty.</p> <p><i>The Dark Horse</i> is sure to build on the success of <i>Another Man's Moccasins</i> as Sheriff Longmire unpins his star and ventures into a town without pity to save a woman without hope.</p>";
