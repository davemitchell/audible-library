window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Isabella Rose, the Angel, is used to surprises, but being abducted is an unwelcome novelty. She's relying on Michael Pope, the head of the top-secret Group Fifteen, to get her back. </p> <p>When ISIS get involved, the situation becomes even bleaker. Isabella's abductors are in turn abducted, and she finds herself trapped in Raqqa, the capital of the self-styled caliphate. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Pope has problems of his own: a new danger has emerged from the shadows and is threatening both him and his family. His only option is to head for the war-torn border of Turkey and Syria - a murderous, lawless place where potential enemies lurk around every bombed-out corner. Pope knows that he is risking everything to find Isabella, but finding the Angel is not a choice - it's a necessity. </p> <p><i>The Asset</i> is the second part in a continuing story involving Isabella Rose that started with <i>Act I: The Angel</i>. The story will be continued in <i>Act III</i>. </p>";
