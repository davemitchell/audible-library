Or two lifetimes, which is the sentence he's serving after being convicted of a crime he was planning to commit but never did. So when an old buddy shows up with a deal that could spring him from his hell behind bars, he's ready to listen. </p> <p>To gain his freedom, Jesse must infiltrate a dangerous and reclusive religious cult that has been stockpiling weapons and eliminating those sent to investigate.

Pitted against not only the cult but the feds who sent him, Jesse feels control of his own life slipping away and must make a final, desperate attempt to regain it - or die trying. </p>";
