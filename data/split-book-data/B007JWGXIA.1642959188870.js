window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>With its revolutionary fly-by-wire technology, the C-500 had become the freight airframe of choice. Until a routine delivery goes horribly wrong. </p> <p>Falling like a stone from six miles up, a brand new C-500 crashes in central France, killing two pilots aboard. When French officials take over this highly public investigation, they call in the best there is: they call Frank \"Jammer\" Davis. </p> <p>A retired U.S. Air Force fighter pilot, Davis is part of the NTSB's \"go-team\". With a reputation for getting things done - and for steamrolling anyone who gets in his way - Davis starts to dig. </p> <p>But just as Davis starts his investigation, news of the crash is overshadowed by a more spectacular disaster: suicide bombers attack oil refineries worldwide, sending governments and financial markets into a tailspin. </p> <p>A relentless Davis keeps investigating, but uncovering the cause of the crash, and its terrifying connection to this worldwide disaster, reveals a conspiracy of unthinkable proportions - a conspiracy he might not be able to stop. </p> <p>Jammer Davis won't stop until he gets answers - or until somebody stops him from getting answers.</p>";
