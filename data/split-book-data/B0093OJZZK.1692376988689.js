window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Randy Wayne White has long been known for suspenseful plots, complex characters, and an extraordinary sense of place. His new series has them all - and then some. </p> <p>Hannah Smith: a tall, strong, formidable Florida woman, the descendant of generations of strong Florida women. She makes her living as a fishing guide, but her friends, neighbors, and clients also know her as an uncommonly resourceful woman with a keen sense of justice - someone who can't be bullied - and they have taken to coming to her with their problems. </p> <p>Her methods can be unorthodox, though, and those on the receiving end of them often wind up very unhappy - and sometimes very violent. And when a girl goes missing, and Hannah is asked to find her, that is exactly what happens....</p>";
