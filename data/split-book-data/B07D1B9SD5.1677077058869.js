window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In present day Los Angeles, the alien takeover has begun—but there’s no spaceship and no little green men. Rather, an epic conspiracy is slowly coming to fruition. Thousands of years ago, beings infiltrated our society, bred with humans, then died—leaving an untraceable, inexplicable anomaly in our DNA. Now that genetic code has activated, and chaos has erupted.</p> <p>But private investigator Tom Lombard has his own chaos to face. His personal life is falling apart, and he just found his latest “missing person” dead in a dumpster. Suddenly he’s being chased by a woman with silver hair and two black-eyed goons with unnatural abilities. And what’s with all these people in masks—and the crazy girl ranting on the internet about the end of the world? Is humanity’s only hope a weird band of eccentrics and one down-on-his-luck, disgraced ex-cop badly in need of a win?</p> <p>In this wild, souped-up apocalyptic vision of Les Bohem—the acclaimed, Emmy Award-winning writer of the Steven Spielberg miniseries, <i>Taken</i>—the reckoning begins, culminating in something truly unexpected. And who better to give voice to the wickedly weird world of Junk than transgressive art icon John Waters, whose simultaneously relaxed and dynamic delivery gives this Audible Original a cool, cinematic feel.</p> <p><i>This title contains explicit language and depictions of physical and sexual violence that may be upsetting to some listeners. Listener discretion is advised.</i>&nbsp;</p>";
