window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>About this Audible Original</b></p> <p>Gritty and suspenseful, Dietrich is a hard-boiled whodunnit from Audie Award-winning and internationally best-selling author Don Winslow, performed by four-time Academy Award nominee Ed Harris.</p> <p>It’s the summer of ’77 in New York City, and the only thing more unnerving than the scorching heatwave is the rampant murder, leaving washed-up homicide detective Richard Dietrich on edge.</p> <p>When Dietrich investigates a brutal mob hit the brass doesn’t want him to solve, he goes from phoning it in to getting in over his head. Caught up in a mysterious second homicide with an even more perplexing perpetrator, Dietrich starts to second guess his instincts—and his memory—as he searches for answers at the bottom of a bottle.</p>";
