window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>Absolute Power</i></b><b> meets </b><b><i>The Manchurian Candidate</i></b><b> in this explosive political thriller from </b><b><i>USA Today</i></b><b> bestselling author Ward Larsen, </b><b><i>Deep Fake</i></b><b>.</b><br> <br> The Cold War is back—but for some it never ended.<br> <br> Sarah Ridgeway is living the life she’s always envisioned. She has a devoted husband, a loving daughter, and a comfortable home. The path to reach it, however, has not always been smooth. For twelve years her husband, Bryce, served in the Army, deployed to some of the world’s worst trouble spots. After his service ended with a combat injury, the future had seemed precarious, but with Sarah’s support and that of his wealthy family, combined with his exemplary service record, he is elected to Congress. <br> <br> Then, in a moment, everything changes: at a drab Washington fundraiser, the junior congressman intervenes in a terrorist attack, and narrowly escapes with his life. When videos of his bravery go viral, he quickly becomes a national hero. The timing could not be more fortuitous. The presidential primaries are heating up, and Bryce’s party is desperate for a fresh candidate to challenge the vulnerable incumbent. <br> <br> Amid the whirlwind, Sarah senses something amiss. Since the attack, Bryce has been forgetful and acting strangely. Could it be the stress? she wonders. Might the recent explosion have aggravated his combat trauma? For the first time ever, she finds herself doubting a man she has always trusted. Confessing her fears to her closest friend, together they quietly search for answers. What they uncover is stunning: the man who might soon be president has a deeply held secret. A secret that will likely destroy Sarah’s life—and certainly lead the nation to ruin.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Forge Books by Ward Larsen</b><br> <i>Cutting Edge</i><br> <br> <b>The David Slaton series</b><i><br> The Perfect Assassin</i><br> <i>Assassin's Game</i><br> <i>Assassin's Silence</i><br> <i>Assassin's Code</i><br> <i>Assassin's Run</i><br> <i>Assassin's Revenge</i><br> <i>Assassin's Strike</i><br> <i>Assassin's Edge</i><br> <i>Assassin's Dawn</i> (novella)<br> <br> <b>A Macmillan Audio production from Forge Books.</b></p>";
