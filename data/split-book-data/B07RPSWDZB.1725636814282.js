window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Who do you trust? Who can you depend on?</p> <p>James Beltz's modern-day gunslinger, known to the rest of us as DJ Slaughter, returns in this thrilling sequel. Book one left us with a massive cliffhanger. Book two serves to answer all of your burning questions in the very first chapter. However, in a sudden, neck-snapping plot twist, you will only be left with more questions. Nice job, James. Very nice job indeed...<br> </p> <p>The first book was a break-neck pace of thrilling adventure, reminding this reviewer of the first season of the Fox TV series \"24\". You know, before it went downhill and got all politically correct. But I digress...this sequel only allows you enough pause to catch your breath and dive deeper into the characters you have come to love. Along with an introduction to a few more you will quickly find yourself attached to. By the time you get to the end, you will feel like you know them all personally.<br> </p> <p>But prepare yourself. The world is littered with villains. James very effectively reminds us that they can spring out at you from places you least expect. This time, DJ has met his match. And how do you beat someone that is better than you? I guess you'll have to listen to the book to find out....</p>";
