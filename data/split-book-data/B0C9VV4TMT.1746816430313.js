window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"Gilstrap pushes every thriller button.\" —</b><b><i>San Francisco Chronicle</i></b></p> <p><b>Unstoppable Jonathan Grave uncovers a major threat to American security in the latest action-packed adventure in the long-running, bestselling black-ops series.</b></p> <p>Henchmen of a vicious drug syndicate have snatched ten missionaries in a remote area of Venezuela and are holding them for ransom. The high-priority rescue op comes as a personal plea from FBI Director Irene Rivers, who has a very special interest in one of the hostages. The mission is strictly off the books, and there can be no international incident. Just get in and get out—and keep the precious cargo safe.</p> <p>With his key operatives Gunslinger and Boxers, Grave infiltrates the enemy camp. Right away, the rescue mission morphs into something far more dangerous—not just to Jonathan and his team, but to the whole world.</p> <p><b>\"[Gilstrap's] greatest strength is the ability to blend breathtaking action with deep emotion regarding the characters.\" —Jeffery Deaver</b></p> <p><b>\"A great hero, a really exciting series.\" —Joseph Finder</b></p>";
