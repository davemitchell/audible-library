Mind-boggling acts of violence in every state.&nbsp;</p> <p>Four Days Ago the murders increased ten-fold....&nbsp;</p> <p>Three days ago the President addressed the nation and begged for calm and peace....&nbsp;</p> <p>Two days ago the killers began to mobilize....&nbsp;</p> <p>Yesterday all the power went out....&nbsp;</p> <p>Tonight they’re reading the names of those to be killed on the Emergency Broadcast System. You are listening over the battery-powered radio on your kitchen table, and they’ve just read yours. Your name is Jack Colclough. You have a wife, a daughter, and a young son. You live in Albuquerque, New Mexico. People are coming to your house to kill you and your family. You don’t know why, but you don’t have time to think about that any more. You only have time to <i>run</i>!&nbsp;</p>";
