window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Thriller Award winner, Best First Novel, 2017. </b></p> <p><b>An explosive thriller debut introducing Peter Ash, a veteran who finds that the demons of war aren't easily left behind....</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>Peter Ash came home from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan with only one souvenir: what he calls his \"white static\", the buzzing claustrophobia due to post-traumatic stress that has driven him to spend a year roaming in nature, sleeping under the stars. But when a friend from the marines commits suicide, Ash returns to civilization to help the man's widow with some home repairs. Under her dilapidated porch, he finds more than he bargained for: the largest, ugliest, meanest dog he's ever encountered...and a Samsonite suitcase stuffed with cash and explosives. As Ash begins to investigate this unexpected discovery, he finds himself at the center of a plot that is far larger than he could have imagined...and it may lead straight back to the world he thought he'd left for good.&nbsp;</p> <p>Suspenseful and thrilling, and featuring a compelling new hero, <i>The Drifter</i> is an exciting debut from a fresh voice in crime fiction.&nbsp;</p>";
