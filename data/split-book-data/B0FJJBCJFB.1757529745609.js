But when a camel wanders down Main Street—its head grotesquely sprouting a dozen eyes—Colton knows his quiet days are over. The bizarre incident leads him to NovaGen, a nearby research facility constructed inside a Cold War bunker, buried in the mountains above town. There, a trail of blood and eerie silence hints at something far more sinister than an escaped animal experiment.</p> <p>With his deputies—the sharp-witted Tali and rookie Ethan—Colton recruits a few trusted locals, including the unshakable Marit, Tali's sister; the intimidating \"Grizz\" Norval; and Edgar \"Old Red\" Rydell, an aging man plagued by demons from when he worked at the bunker during its covert days.</p> <p>Together, they investigate the abandoned lab. What begins as a search for missing scientists soon reveals chilling evidence: pools of blood without bodies, cryptic warnings left behind, a bloody six-fingered handprint, and the revelation of a generative AI capable of printing living organisms. As they descend deeper into the lab, it becomes clear the answers they seek may come at a terrifying cost—and what was made in the dark may not be content to stay there.</p> <p><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> and #1 Audible bestselling author, Jeremy Robinson reclaims his title as one of the best Michael Crichton successors with this harrowing blend of suspense, science, and survival. </b><b><i>Artifact</i></b><b> takes listeners into a frozen abyss where innovation and nightmares collide.</b></p>";
