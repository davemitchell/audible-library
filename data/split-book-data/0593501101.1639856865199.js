A former forest ranger and unwavering tech skeptic, she charms her way into an entry-level job with one goal in mind: to take down the company from within.

But does anyone want what Delaney is fighting to save? Does humanity truly want to be free?</p> <p>Studded with unforgettable characters, outrageous outfits, and lacerating set-pieces, this companion to <i>The Circle</i> blends absurdity and terror, satire and suspense, while keeping the listener in apprehensive excitement about the fate of the company - and the human animal.</p>";
