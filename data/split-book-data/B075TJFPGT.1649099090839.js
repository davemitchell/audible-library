window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Winner of the 2019 Audie Award for Thriller/Suspense Audiobook </b></p> <p><i>Crimson Lake</i> by Sydney-based, Ned Kelly Award-winning author Candice Fox is a thrilling contemporary crime audiobook set in Queensland, Australia - perfect for listeners who like to immerse themselves in exotic, evocative climes.&nbsp;</p> <p>Six minutes in the wrong place at the wrong time - that's all it took to ruin Sydney Detective Ted Conkaffey's life. Accused but not convicted of the brutal abduction of a 13-year-old girl, Ted is now a free man - and public enemy number one. He flees north to keep a low profile amid the steamy, croc-infested wetlands of Crimson Lake.&nbsp;</p> <p>There, Ted's lawyer introduces him to Private Investigator Amanda Pharrell, herself a convicted murderer. Perhaps it's the self-isolation and murderous past that makes her so adept at tracking lost souls in the wilderness, but her latest target, missing author Jake Scully, has a life more shrouded in secrets than her own.&nbsp;</p> <p>Not entirely convinced Amanda is a cold-blooded killer, Ted agrees to help with her investigation, a case full of deception and obsession, while secretly digging into her troubled past. The residents of Crimson Lake are watching the pair's every move....&nbsp;</p> <p>Once Ted's true identity becomes known, the threats against him become violent, and the town offers no place to hide.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Candice Fox's new audiobook proves that mysteries are even more thrilling when they take place down under.</b></p> <p><i>This program includes a bonus conversation with the author.</i></p>";
