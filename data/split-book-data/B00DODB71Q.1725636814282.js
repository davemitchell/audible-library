window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>“A genre-defying blend of crime writing and science fiction.”—Alexandra Alter, </b><b><i>The New York Times</i></b></p> <p><b>Detective Hank Palace returns in the second in the speculative mystery trilogy set on the brink of the apocalypse.</b></p> <p>There are just 77 days before a deadly asteroid collides with Earth, and Detective Palace is out of a job. With the Concord police force operating under the auspices of the U.S. Justice Department, Hank's days of solving crimes are over...until a woman from his past begs for help finding her missing husband.</p> <p>Brett Cavatone disappeared without a trace—an easy feat in a world with no phones, no cars, and no way to tell whether someone’s gone “bucket list” or just <i>gone</i>. With society falling to shambles, Hank pieces together what few clues he can, on a search that leads him from a college-campus-turned-anarchist-encampment to a crumbling coastal landscape where anti-immigrant militia fend off “impact zone” refugees.</p> <p><i>Countdown City</i> presents another fascinating mystery set on brink of an apocalypse--and once again, Hank Palace confronts questions way beyond \"whodunit.\" <i>What do we as human beings owe to one another? And what does it mean to be civilized when civilization is collapsing all around you?</i></p>";
