window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Virgil Flowers investigates a miracle - and a murder - in the wickedly entertaining new thriller from the master of \"pure reading pleasure\" (</b><b><i>Booklist</i></b><b>) </b></p> <p>Pinion, Minnesota: a metropolis of all of 700 souls, for which the word <i>moribund</i> might have been invented. Nothing ever happened there, and nothing ever would - until the mayor of sorts (campaign slogan: \"I'll Do What I Can\") and a buddy come up with a scheme to put Pinion on the map. They'd heard of a place where a floating image of the Virgin Mary had turned the whole town into a shrine, attracting thousands of pilgrims. And all those pilgrims needed food, shelter, all kinds of crazy things, right? They'd all get rich! What could go wrong?&nbsp;</p> <p>When the dead body shows up, they find out, and that's only the beginning of their troubles - and Virgil Flowers' - as they are all about to discover all too soon.</p>";
