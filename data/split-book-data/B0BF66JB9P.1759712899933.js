Welcome to another wild adventure in Carl Hiaasen's Florida!</b></p> <p>Valdez Jones VIII calls himself Wrecker because his great-great-great-great-great-grandfather salvaged shipwrecks for a living.</p> <p>So is it destiny, irony, or just bad luck when Wrecker comes across a speedboat that has run hard aground on a sand flat? The men in the boat don't want Wrecker to call for help—in fact, they'll pay him to forget he ever saw them.</p> <p>Wrecker would be happy to forget, but he keeps seeing these men all over Key West—at the marina, in the cemetery, even right outside his own door. And now they want more than his silence—they want a lookout.</p> <p>He'll have to dive deep into their shady dealings to figure out a way to escape <i>this</i> tangled net. . . .</p>";
