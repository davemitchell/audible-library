window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"Nonstop action at a machine gun pace. If you aren't reading Nick Petrie, now is the time to start.\" (C.J. Box)</p> <p><b>Peter Ash tangles with dangerous enemies and terrifying technology in the newest thriller from best-selling author Nick Petrie.</b></p> <p>A man wanted by two governments, Peter Ash has found a simple, low-profile life in Milwaukee, living with his girlfriend, June, and renovating old buildings with his friend Lewis. Staying out of trouble is the key to preserving this fragile peace...but when Peter spots a suspicious armed man walking into a crowded market, he knows he can't stand by and do nothing.</p> <p>Peter does interrupt a crime, but it wasn't at all what he'd expected. The young gunman appeared to have one target and one mission - but when he escapes, and his victim vanishes before police arrive, it seems there is more to the encounter than meets the eye. Peter's hunch is proven correct when a powerful associate from his past appears with an interest in the crime and an irresistible offer: If he and June solve this mystery, Peter's record will be scrubbed clean.</p> <p>While Peter and Lewis trace the gunman, reporter June digs into the victim of the incident, a man whose face rings a bell in her memory. As their parallel investigations draw together, they're thrust into the path of a ruthless tech thief, an eerily cheerful assassin, a brilliant and troubled inventor, and a revolutionary technology that could wreak devastation in the wrong hands. But for Peter, even more is at stake: This investigation is his only path to a life free from the threat of prosecution or prison. Before the end, he'll have to fight harder than ever before to ensure that freedom doesn't come at too high a cost....</p>";
