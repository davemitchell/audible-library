window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Now part of American film and literary lore, Tom Ripley, \"a bisexual psychopath and art forger who murders without remorse when his comforts are threatened\" (<i>New York Times Book Review</i>), was Patricia Highsmith's favorite creation. </p> <p>In <i>The Boy Who Followed Ripley</i>, Highsmith explores Ripley's bizarrely paternal relationship with a troubled young runaway, whose abduction draws them into Berlin's seamy underworld. More than any other American literary character, Ripley provides \"a lens to peer into the sinister machinations of human behavior.\" (John Freeman, <i>Pittsburgh Gazette</i>).</p>";
