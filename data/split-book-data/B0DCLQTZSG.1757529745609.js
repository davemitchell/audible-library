His latest bad decision? Picking up a hitchhiker on a rainy afternoon while running an errand.</p> <p>That errand sets off a chain reaction involving Viva Morales, a clever, resilient newcomer trying to rebuild her life post-divorce. She’s renting a room in Figgo’s apartment and working at the Mink Foundation—a philanthropic front with something far darker beneath the surface.</p> <p>Circling them is Twilly Spree, a hotheaded environmentalist with too much cash and a gift for over-the-top revenge.</p> <p>When dark money and twisted motives bring their worlds crashing together, Viva and Twilly become unlikely allies. Together, they uncover a tangle of corruption and conspiracy led by a plastic-surgery-loving billionaire couple and a clueless congressman with delusions of grandeur.</p> <p>In his most outrageous and deliciously funny novel yet, Hiaasen delivers a gleefully chaotic portrait of contemporary madness.</p>";
