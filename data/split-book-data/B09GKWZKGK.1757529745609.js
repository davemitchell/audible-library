He’s just passing through the town of Alencourt, France, and in less than an hour, someone tries to kill him. Nice place, nice try. But it’s a case of mistaken identity, and they picked the wrong guy. The French police can’t be trusted, except for the beautiful Cecile Nazari. She finds out fast that keeping up with Keeler is a dangerous occupation. Because someone’s preying on the weak and unprotected. Someone murderous. But they never counted on coming up against a guy like Keeler.</p>";
