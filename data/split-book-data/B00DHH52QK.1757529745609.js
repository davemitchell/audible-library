But nothing has ever been quite so politically sensitive, or has hit so close to home, as the task Mahoney hands DeMarco in <i>House Odds</i>, the latest novel from critically acclaimed thriller writer Mike Lawson. </p> <p>Mahoney’s daughter, Molly, has been arrested and charged with insider trading. An engineer with a high-flying technology firm, she allegedly placed a half-million-dollar bet on one of the firm’s clients. DeMarco’s job is to clear Molly’s name and keep his boss clean. But how did Molly get her hands on so much money to invest in the first place? Before long, DeMarco discovers that there’s far more to Molly’s case than meets the eye, and the risk to Mahoney is more than just a little political embarrassment. Featuring an extensive cast of mobsters and politicians, <i>House Odds</i> is a gripping tale of high-stakes scheming from one of today’s best political thriller writers.</p>";
