But when they discover five girls have been murdered in Bethnal Green, taunting letters begin to arrive in Craig's Court from a killer calling himself Mr. Miacca. </p> <p>Barker fears that Miacca might be part of the Hellfire Club, a group of powerful, hedonistic aristocrats performing satanic rituals. He must track the fiend to his hideout, while Llewelyn confronts the man who put him in prison. </p> <p>Dodging muckrakers, navigating the murky Thames under cover of darkness, and infiltrating London's most powerful secret society, <i>The Hellfire Conspiracy </i>is another wild ride that \"brings to life a London roiling with secret leagues, deadly organizations, and hidden clubs\" (Ron Bernas, <i>Detroit Free Press</i>). </p>";
