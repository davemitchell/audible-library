window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Setting down his thoughts on swordplay, on winning, and on spirituality, legendary swordsman Miyamoto Musashi intended this modest work as a guide for his immediate disciples and future generations of samurai. He had little idea he was penning a masterpiece that would be eagerly devoured by people in all walks of life centuries after his death. </p> <p>Along with <i>The Art of War</i> by Sun Tzu, <i>The Book of Five Rings</i> has long been regarded as an invaluable treatise on the strategy of winning. Musashi's timeless advice on defeating an adversary, throwing an opponent off-guard, creating confusion, and other techniques for overpowering an assailant was addressed to readers of earlier times on the battlefield and now serves the modern listener in the battle of life.</p> <p> In this new rendering by the translator of <i>Hagakure</i> and <i>The Unfettered Mind</i>, William Scott Wilson adheres rigorously to the 17th-century Japanese text and clarifies points of ambiguity in earlier translations. In addition, he offers an extensive introduction and a translation of Musashi's rarely published <i>The Way of Walking Alone</i>.</p>";
