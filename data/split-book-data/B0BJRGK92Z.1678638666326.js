window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An audio original novella from the bestselling author of </b><b><i>Ordinary Grace</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>This Tender Land</i></b><b>, </b><b><i>The Levee</i></b><b> is a powerful, captivating story of a family, a storm, a complicated rescue, and the true cost of survival.</b></p> <p>“A masterwork… Full of heart and a spellbinding plot, Krueger packs a powerful punch in this audio novella, delivering grand scale storytelling at its finest.”–Kim Michele Richardson, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Book Woman’s Daughter</i></p> <p>It’s 1927, and the most devastating flood in American history has swelled the Mississippi River to a width of eighty miles. In an attempt to save a family trapped by the rising water, four men in a tiny rowboat battle the treacherous flow: three are convicts, on loan from the local prison and pressed into service; the fourth, the leader of the team, is driven by his own hidden motives. But to their surprise upon arrival at Ballymore, an ancestral home protected by a high, circular levee, not everyone in the family feels the need to be saved. Pride, greed, loyalty, and even love create their own complex currents behind the massive wall. As the threat from the flood increases and time ticks away, the crew and the family must decide on a course of action, and a desperate plan is hatched to save the weakening levee and all it was built to protect.</p> <p><i>The Levee</i> is a propulsive, heartfelt tale of courage, cowardice, and sacrifice in a historic moment when the indomitable human spirit is pitted against the awesome and destructive power of nature.</p> <p><b>This audiobook includes an author’s note read by the author, a reader’s group guide (available in your Audible library along with the audio), and a preview of William Kent Krueger’s next novel, </b><b><i>The River We Remember</i></b><b>.</b></p> <p>\"Will the levee hold? Or will greed, pride, and hubris engulf the characters of <i>The Levee </i>like the historic flood waters of the Mississippi River threatening the inhabitants of Ballymore? William Kent Krueger's masterful tale of suspense about courage, family, secrets, and the power of nature is a must-listen!\"–Marie Benedict, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Only Woman in the Room</i> and <i>The Personal Librarian</i></p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
