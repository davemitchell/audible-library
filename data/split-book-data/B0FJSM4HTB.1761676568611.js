She identifies the dead woman as private detective Zoë Boehm, but putting a name to the corpse only raises further questions. Did Zoë kill herself, or did one of her old cases come back to haunt her? Why was she wearing the jacket a murderer had stolen years before? And what’s brought Sarah’s former sparring partner Gerard Inchon to the same broken-down hotel she’s staying at? Coincidence is an excuse that soon appears pretty unconvincing. Sarah can’t leave until she’s found the answers to her questions, however dangerous they might turn out to be.</p><p> </p><p><i>“In this assured mystery from British author Herron … does a nice job of planting red herrings and making [Sarah Tucker's] amateur sleuthing plausible.”</i>—<i><b>PUBLISHERS WEEKLY</b></i></p>";
