window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>David Archer is back with a vengeance with his newest hero, Noah Wolf. After fans raved about his debut series, The Sam Prichard novels, Archer now is about to back even harder. People are already throwing out names like Mitch Rapp and Alex Cross, but don't take my word for it. See what all the fuss is about before Archer becomes a household name! </p> <p>What happens to a seven-year-old boy who sees his parents die in a murder suicide? There is trauma, of course, and an impact to his emotional health from which you may never recover. Noah Foster was that boy, and his struggle with post-traumatic stress has left him without emotions, without a conscience and without whatever it is that once made him human. The only thing he's got now is his friends, and with their help and guidance, Noah will learn how to disguise himself, how to hide his wolf-like nature in the clothing of the man he will grow to become. But one can only pretend for so long, and eventually even Noah isn't able to keep the Wolf at bay. </p>";
