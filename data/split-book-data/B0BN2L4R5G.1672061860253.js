window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Multiple time </b><b><i>USA Today</i></b><b> and Amazon 5-million copy best-selling authors David Archer and Blake Banner have combined forces to create one hell of a thriller series!</b></p> <p>The Russians have a special way of gambling. They take a revolver and they place one round the chambers and spin it. Then they take it in turns to put the gun to their heads and pull the trigger.</p> <p>It’s called Russian Roulette.</p> <p>Now they have a new, deadlier way of playing it.</p> <p>Six Tactical Nuclear Devices at six different locations–locations known to just one man. It might be a rucksack on a picnic trail, a suitcase at a bus station, a car parked in the heart of New York. But only one is real. Maximum stress and disruption for minimum cost.</p> <p>The game is played by informing the media that five dummies and one dirty nuclear bomb have been planted around the USA. Clues to their whereabouts have been sent to the Pentagon. But here’s the rub: concealed in the clues is the trigger that will detonate the real device. Open the wrong trunk, pick up the wrong suitcase, and the fall out could be devastating–literally.</p> <p>The CIA say it’s the Feds’ case. The Feds say it belongs to the CIA. The President says it’s ODIN’s, and it’s a job for Alex Mason.</p>";
