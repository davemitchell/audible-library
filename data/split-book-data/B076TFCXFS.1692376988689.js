window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From crime writer Steve Cavanagh comes another gripping audiobook featuring lawyer Eddie Flynn. This is the legal thriller listeners have been waiting for.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>An innocent client. A wife in jeopardy. Who will take </b><b><i>The Plea</i></b><b>? </b></p> <p>Billionaire David Child swears he didn’t murder his girlfriend, Clara. But the evidence overwhelmingly shows that David killed her: the security video showed no one else entering their apartment, the murder weapon was in his car, and he was covered in gunshot residue he can’t explain.</p> <p>The FBI believes David’s arrest and obvious guilt could help them take down a huge money-laundering scheme - if they can get him to testify.</p> <p>Con-artist-turned-lawyer Eddie Flynn is given the job: persuade David to plead guilty and give the agents the evidence they need. If Eddie can’t get David to take a plea bargain, the FBI has incriminating files on Eddie’s wife - and will send her to jail. But David insists that he didn’t murder anyone.</p> <p>As the FBI pressures Eddie to secure the guilty plea, Eddie becomes increasingly convinced that David is telling the truth. With adversaries threatening, Eddie has to find a way to prove David’s innocence and find out if there’s any way he might have been framed. But the stakes are high: Eddie’s wife is in danger. And not just from the FBI....</p>";
