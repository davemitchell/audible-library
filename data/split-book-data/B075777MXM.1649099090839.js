She's putting the pieces of her life back in order and is ready to tackle whatever the future holds. </p> <p>Too bad the future is a nasty bitch. There's a new kind of zombie in town: mindless shamblers, infectious and ravenous. </p> <p>With the threat of a full-blown shambler pandemic looming, and a loved one stricken, Angel and the \"real\" zombies scramble to find a cure. Yet when Angel uncovers the true reason the plague is spreading so quickly, she adds \"no-holds-barred revenge\" to her to-do list. Angel is busting her ass dealing with shambling hordes, zombie gators, government jerks, and way too many mosquitos, but this white trash chick ain't giving up. </p> <p>Good thing, since the fate of the world is resting on her undead shoulders. </p>";
