window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Young Fletch is less than pleased to be writing a business story, something that's well outside his field of expertise. Eager to get back out on the streets, he quickly compiles what he thinks is a well-executed article, complete with quotes from the chairman of the board's recent memos. But when he fails to do his due diligence when researching the company and its associates, he finds himself in hot water...and now out of a job. The chairman has been dead for more than a year.</p> <p>Realizing his mistake, he visits the widow, Bradley, to make amends - and to ask a few simple questions. But her strange demeanor and puzzling answers leave Fletch perplexed. He can't help but wonder: Why would a dead man still be writing memos to his associates? Is he even dead?</p> <p>With his interest now thoroughly piqued, fueled by his desire to get the real story and take back his job, Fletch puts his reporting skills to work as he dives into the mystery surrounding the Bradleys' past.</p>";
