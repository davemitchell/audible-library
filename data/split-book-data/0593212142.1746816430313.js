Once she settles with her husband on Henley Street in Stratford-upon-Avon she becomes a fiercely protective mother and a steadfast, centrifugal force in the life of her young husband, whose career on the London stage is taking off when his beloved young son succumbs to sudden fever.</p> <p>A luminous portrait of a marriage, a shattering evocation of a family ravaged by grief and loss, and a tender and unforgettable re-imagining of a boy whose life has been all but forgotten, and whose name was given to one of the most celebrated plays of all time, <i>Hamnet</i> is mesmerizing, seductive, impossible to put down—a magnificent leap forward from one of our most gifted novelists.</p> <p><b>Don’t miss Maggie O’Farrell’s new novel, </b><b><i>The Marriage Portrait</i></b><b>!</b></p>";
