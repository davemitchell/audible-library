Until a routine delivery goes horribly wrong. </p> <p>Falling like a stone from six miles up, a brand new C-500 crashes in central France, killing two pilots aboard. When French officials take over this highly public investigation, they call in the best there is: they call Frank \"Jammer\" Davis. </p> <p>A retired U.S. Air Force fighter pilot, Davis is part of the NTSB's \"go-team\".
