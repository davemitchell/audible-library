Now, to save the life of another, he must return to Syria and confront his biggest failure in a debut thriller Lee Child calls \"sensationally good.\"</b></p> <p>Defense Intelligence Agency operative Matt Drake broke a promise. A promise that cost three people their lives and crippled his best friend. Three months later, he's paralyzed by survivor's guilt and haunted by the memories of the fallen.
