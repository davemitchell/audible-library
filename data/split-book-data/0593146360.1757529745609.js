And for Department Q’s Assad, Victim 2117 is a link to his buried past - and the family he assumed was long dead.</p> <p>With the help of the Department Q squad - Carl, Rose, and Gordon - Assad must finally confront painful memories from his years in the Middle East in order to find and capture Ghaalib.
