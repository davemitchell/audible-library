While there, they will be working with a small team to track down one of the masterminds behind the USS <i>Cole</i> bombing: A high-ranking Al Qaeda operative known as The Panther. Ruthless and elusive, he's wanted for multiple terrorist acts and murders—and the US Government is determined to bring him down, no matter the cost.
