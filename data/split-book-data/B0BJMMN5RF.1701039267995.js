For that reason it’s level of security is the highest on the planet.</p> <p>Or so they thought, until top ODIN agent Mira Finn was murdered in Paris, her tortured body dragged from the Seine. A handful of people knew she was in France, fewer than that knew what her mission was. Two of them were Alex Mason and Nero, the chief of Odin itself, the other two were General Patrick O’Connor, chief security advisor to the President, and the President himself.</p> <p>One of those four men was the traitor who had leaked Mira’s mission. Of the remaining three, only two were innocent. The other was the scapegoat.</p> <p>Alex Mason knew that was him. He was officially on the run and he had 36 hours to find the truth, clear his name, and avert a global catastrophe of unprecedented proportions.</p>";
