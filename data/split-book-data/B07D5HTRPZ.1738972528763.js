window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The author of the #1 </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestseller </b><b><i>The Anxious Generation</i></b><b> shows how a deeper understanding of the world's philosophical wisdom can enrich and transform our lives</b><br> <br> Jonathan Haidt skillfully combines two genres-philosophical wisdom and scientific research-delighting the listener with surprising insights. He explains, for example, why we have such difficulty controlling ourselves and sticking to our plans; why no achievement brings lasting happiness, yet a few changes in your life can have profound effects, and why even confirmed atheists experience spiritual elevation. In a stunning final chapter, Haidt addresses the grand question \"How can I live a meaningful life?,\" offering an original answer that draws on the rich inspiration of both philosophy and science.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
