window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>You can't outrun your past.</b> </p> <p>A code hidden in plain sight. An American black ops team that went too far. </p> <p>John Hayes, a disgraced elite soldier, returns from exile and risks everything to get back to his wife and daughter and to take revenge on his accusers with a series of escalating attacks inside the United States. Thomas Byrne is the only man who can stop him. Byrne once fought alongside Hayes as a combat medic, but he gave up the gun. Now a surgeon, he moves from town to town trying to forget his past - until he is called upon by a high-ranking government official to help capture the man he once called a friend. </p> <p>Hayes and Byrne were once closer than brothers. But with the fate of the nation hanging in the balance, both must decide whom to trust - and whom to betray. In a final explosive battle for justice, they face off along a rifle's cold barrel. </p> <p><i>Cold Barrel Zero</i> brings together the blistering pace of Lee Child, the nonstop action of Vince Flynn, and the richly drawn characters and moral stakes of Daniel Silva. An experienced reporter armed with deep behind-the-scenes research into America's Special Operations forces, Quirk takes the military thriller to a new level of suspense. </p>";
