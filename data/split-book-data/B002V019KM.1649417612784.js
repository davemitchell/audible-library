Easy knows that this could only mean that ex-marine Black is probably dead, or will be soon. <p> But Easter's appearance is only the beginning, as Easy is immersed in a sea of problems. The love of his life is marrying another man, and his friend Mouse is wanted for the murder of a father of 12. As he's searching for a clue to Christmas Black's whereabouts, two suspicious MPs hire him to find his friend Black on behalf of the U.S. Army.</p> <p> Easy's investigation brings him to a blonde woman, Faith Laneer, whose past is as dark as her beauty is bright. As Easy begins to put the pieces together, he realizes that Black's disappearance has its roots in Vietnam, and that Faith might be in a world of danger.</p>";
