window.bookSummaryJSON = "Who hasn't dreamed of finding a million dollars? <p>Joey Coyle was down and out - the affable, boyish South Philadelphian hadn't found dock work in months, he was living with his ailing mother, and he was fighting a drug habit and what seemed like a lifetime of bouncing into and out of bad luck. One morning, while cruising the streets just blocks from his home, fate took a turn worthy of Hollywood when he spotted a curious yellow tub he thought might make a good toolbox. It contained $1.2 million in unmarked bills - casino money that had just fallen off the back of an armored truck.</p> <p>Detective Pat Laurenzi, with the help of the FBI, was working around the clock to track it down. Joey Coyle, meanwhile, was off on a bungling, swashbuckling misadventure, sharing his windfall with everyone from his girlfriend to total strangers to the two neighborhood kids who drove him past it. To hide the money, Joey turned to the local mob boss - a shadowy, fearsome man who may or may not have helped launder it. But as adrenaline-filled nights began taking their toll, Joey Coyle's dream-come-true evolved into a nightmare: Whom could he trust?</p> <p>By one of our most evocative and versatile chroniclers of American life, <i>Finders Keepers</i> is not only a gripping true-life thriller; it is the remarkable tale of an ordinary man faced with an extraordinary dilemma, and the fascinating reactions - from complicity to concern to betrayal - of the friends, family, and neighbors to whom he turns.</p>";
