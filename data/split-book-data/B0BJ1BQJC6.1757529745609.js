In this book, he shows you how to: <br> <br> • Harness your brain chemistry to eliminate the freeze response and increase your stress tolerance during a crisis<br> • Fortify your home by learning how to use and store essential foods, water, supplies, first aid, and ammunition in your everyday life<br> • Equip your vehicle with sufficient first aid, so you can respond to injuries even before an ambulance arrives—dramatically increasing your chance of survival in an accident<br> <br> Drawing on Glover’s most dire experiences in combat and in the real world, this book shows you how almost no disaster is more powerful than someone who is truly prepared. For Glover, surviving catastrophe is not about fearing crisis, but creating more resilient habits so that you can be ready for whatever comes your way.</p>";
