window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Charles Warren, Los Angeles attorney, has dedicated his career to aiding people in financial straits. He is particularly skilled at the art of recovering assets that have been embezzled or hidden. In his newest case, helping a beautiful young widow find the money missing from her late husband's investment accounts, Charlie recognizes a familiar schemeâ€”one that echoes the con job that targeted his own widowed mother many years before, and that led him, as a teenager, to commit a crime of retribution that still weighs on his conscience.<br> <br> Charlie can't get the present case out of his mind, but within hours of starting his investigation, he is followed, shot at, and has his briefcase stolen. It's clear that someone doesn't want him following the trail of the missing money but, as Charlie continues to pursue answers, he quickly becomes too entangled in the web of fraud, betrayal, and career criminals surrounding the theft to escape its deadly snare.<br> <br> A nail-biting tale of conspiracy and pursuit from Thomas Perry, \"a dominating force in the world of contemporary suspense thrillers\" (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>), <i>Pro Bono</i> is sure to have listeners on the edge of their seats.</p>";
