window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Fletch's trip to Brazil wasn't exactly planned. But it's Carnival time in Rio, and he has plenty of money, thanks to a little arrangement he made stateside. It took him no time to hook up with the luscious Laura Soares. Fletch is beginning to relax, just a little.</p> <p>But between the American widow who seems to be following Fletch and the Brazilian widow who's fingered Fletch as her long-dead husband, he suddenly doesn't have much time to enjoy the present or even get a wink of sleep.</p> <p>A 30-year-old unsolved murder, a more recent suicide, an inconvenient heart attack - somehow Fletch is connected to all of them, and one of those connections might just shorten his own life. From Rio to Bahia and back again at the height of Carnival, Fletch has to keep moving or get stopped cold.</p>";
