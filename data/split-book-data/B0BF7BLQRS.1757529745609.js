His job is to be the Eyes—to see everything that happens within the park and report back to the park’s elders, three ancient Bison. His friends—a seagull, a raccoon, a squirrel, and a pelican—work with him as the Assistant Eyes, observing the humans and other animals who share the park and making sure the Equilibrium is in balance.<br> <br> But changes are afoot. More humans arrive in the park. A new building, containing mysterious and hypnotic rectangles, goes up. And then there are the goats—an actual <i>boatload </i>of goats—who appear, along with a shocking revelation that changes Johannes’s view of the world.<br> <br> This story about friendship, beauty, and liberation (and running very, <i>very </i>fast) will make listeners of all ages see the world around them in a wholly new way.</p>";
