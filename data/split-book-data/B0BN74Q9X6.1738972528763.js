A group of idealistic young volunteers enters the rain forest to prove the tribesmen were provoked. One is killed, and another, Fiadh Connor, goes missing.</p> <p>Fiadh's father, billionaire Cuchulain Connor, hires Breed to find her. Connor helps Breed get a ride with Brazil's Minister of the Interior who is mounting an expedition to relieve the besieged outpost.

They all have something to hide and at least one of them is a killer.</p> <p>One murder follows another as the Nevoa crawls up the Rio Preto. It soon becomes apparent that Breed is in the crosshairs—someone does not want him to accomplish his mission.</p> <p>Close Quarters—Book Four in the stunning Breed action thriller series. Perfect for fans of Lee Child, Jason Kasper, and Jack Carr.</p>";
