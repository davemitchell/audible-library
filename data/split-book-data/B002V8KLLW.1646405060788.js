But when he crosses paths with a fetching Broadway actress - and sometime lip model - Stone gets a little more deeply involved with business than he'd expected. When his new lady love turns out to be a lady with a shady past, Stone and downtown cop Dino Bacchetti realize that her beauty may have an unusually high price.</p>";
