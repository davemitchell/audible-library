Their travels together lead them from Wichita to Europe, but trailing them is some unwanted baggage: His new lady love’s unstable, criminal ex-boyfriend. And while Stone is fending off his newest adversary, trouble is brewing on the international stage. Several enemy operatives are at large, and only a coordinated intelligence effort will have any chance of stopping their deadly plot. But the clock is ticking...and time has nearly run out.</p>";
