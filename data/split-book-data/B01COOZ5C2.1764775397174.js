At Thornfield, Jane meets the complex and mysterious Mr. Rochester, with whom she shares a complicated relationship that ultimately forces her to reconcile the conflicting passions of romantic love and religious piety. Performing the early Victorian novel with great care and respect, actress Thandiwe Newton (<i>Crash</i>, <i>The Pursuit of Happyness</i>) draws out <i>Jane Eyre</i>'s intimacy and depth while conveying how truly progressive Brontë was in an era of extreme restraint. </p>";
