window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A “superb fantasy saga” (Helene Wecker) of martial arts and magic, about what happens when a prophesied hero is not the chosen one after all—but has to work with a band of unlikely allies to save the kingdom anyway, from the #1 </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author of </b><b><i>The Lives of Tao</i></b></p> <p><b>“An ambitious and touching exploration of disillusionment in faith, tradition, and family—a glorious reinvention of fantasy and wuxia tropes.”—Naomi Novik, </b><b><i>New York Times </i></b><b>bestselling author of </b><b><i>A Deadly Education</i></b></p> <p><b>ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR: <i>Gizmodo, Kirkus Reviews, </i>The Quill to Live</b></p> <p>So many stories begin the same way: With a prophecy. A chosen one. And the inevitable quest to slay a villain, save the kingdom, and fulfill a grand destiny.</p> <p>But this is not that kind of story.</p> <p>It does begin with a prophecy: A child will rise to defeat the Eternal Khan, a cruel immortal god-king, and save the kingdom.</p> <p>And that prophecy did anoint a hero, Jian, raised since birth in luxury and splendor, and celebrated before he has won a single battle.</p> <p>But that’s when the story hits its first twist: The prophecy is wrong.</p> <p>What follows is a story more wondrous than any prophecy could foresee, and with many unexpected heroes: Taishi, an older woman who is the greatest grandmaster of magical martial arts in the kingdom but who thought her adventuring days were all behind her; Sali, a straitlaced warrior who learns the rules may no longer apply when the leader to whom she pledged her life is gone; and Qisami, a chaotic assassin who takes a little too much pleasure in the kill.</p> <p>And Jian himself, who has to find a way to become what he no longer believes he can be—a hero after all.</p>";
