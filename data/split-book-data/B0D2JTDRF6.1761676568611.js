Both government agencies believe it’s nothing more than a minor terrorist attack, but Pike suspects that something much more sinister is at play. After another terrorist operation at the Taj Mahal, he begins to believe that outside powers are attacking India in the gray zone between peace and war, part of a proxy war that leverages terrorist groups for nothing more than economic gain and control of rare earth minerals. But the separatists conducting the operations have their own agenda.</p> <p>After a massive slaughter and kidnapping of hostages during an elaborate Indian pre-wedding party, two global powers are destabilized, and only Pike Logan and his team can de-escalate the tension by rescuing the captives. What follows is a race against the clock that winds through the bustling markets of Old Delhi, the luxurious resorts of Goa, and the epic halls of the Taj Mahal. It will take everything that Logan and the taskforce have to foil an intricate plot that leaves countless lives in the balance.</p> <p><b>\"Diligent spycraft, throat-clutching suspense, and military action that rips straight off the page. And this outing shows how political gamesmanship operates deep in the shadows, where nothing is black and white, only shades of gray.\" —James Rollins, #1 </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author of </b><b><i>Arkangel</i></b></p>";
