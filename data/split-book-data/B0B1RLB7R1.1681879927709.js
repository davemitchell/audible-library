window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In <i>Deep Hole</i>, one of the world’s foremost crime novelists crafts a sweet, poignant romance novella that could only come from his perfectly calibrated sense of time and place. It incorporates fights and misunderstandings and rejection, and is set against the backdrop of a quiet surfing town in Rhode Island where everyone knows each other’s business—and pleasure. Gambling, deceit, and love intertwine in unexpected ways to deliver a satisfying love story with the requisite Don Winslow side dishes of sly wit, piercing honesty, and a dash of sexiness to accompany the crackling yarn.&nbsp;</p>";
