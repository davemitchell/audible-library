window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>With his series of thrillers starring congressional fixer Joe DeMarco, Mike Lawson has earned a reputation as a master of political intrigue and one of the best writers focusing on the behind-the-scenes action of our nation’s capital. </p> <p>In&nbsp;<i>House Blood,</i> Lawson introduces us to Orson Mulray, CEO of Mulray Pharma, a cold and calculating man obsessed with profit and prestige. Mulray believes he has discovered a drug that could prevent a previously incurable disease. It could be the salvation of millions of people and earn him billions of dollars. But the drug needs to be tested on human subjects, and Mulray needs more than blood samples - he needs autopsy results. </p> <p>When DeMarco is asked to look into the murder conviction of a lobbyist, he has other worries on his mind: His boss is no longer Speaker, his girlfriend has left him, and his friend Emma may be dying. DeMarco doesn’t expect to free the lobbyist - much less become the target of two of the most callous killers he and Emma have ever encountered. </p> <p>The seventh book in this celebrated series is a rollicking ride to Uganda, Peru, and beyond. Lawson expertly commands Washington politics, mercenaries, and the pharmaceutical industry for a juicy story full of lifelike characters and thrilling action. </p> <p>Mike Lawson,a former senior civilian executive for the US Navy, is the author of six novels starring Joe DeMarco. His first book, <i>The Inside Ring,</i> was rated by the <i>Seattle Times</i> as one of the top 10 thrillers of 2005 and was nominated for a Barry Award.</p>";
