But when Yu's mutilated body washes up on a beach near Hong Kong along with dozens of other victims, the case takes a macabre turn. Suddenly Nick finds himself embroiled in another bioterrorism investigation being conducted by China's elite Snow Leopard counterterrorism unit and the Chinese CDC, this time involving illegally harvested organs for an unknown and nefarious end. </p> <p>But Nick's investigation does not go unnoticed, and soon he finds a target on his back. After thwarting an attempt on his life, he is forced to go off the grid and enlist the help of beautiful CDC microbiologist Dr. Dazhong \"Dash\" Chen to help unmask his would-be killer. On the run and looking for answers, their budding romance is tested at every turn. </p> <p>With each step closer they take to unmasking the truth, Nick and Dash find themselves drawn deeper into a global conspiracy that began over 2,000 years ago with the first emperor of China and now threatens to upset the world order as they know it in <i>Hong Kong Black</i>, the heart-pounding sequel to Alex Ryan's <i>Beijing Red</i>. </p>";
