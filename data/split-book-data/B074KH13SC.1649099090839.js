window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Step aside, Jason Bourne: David Slaton, the perfect assassin, returns for another adrenaline-packed adventure by <i>USA Today</i> best-selling author Ward Larsen in <i>Assassin's Code</i>.</b> </p> <p>Former assassin David Slaton discovers a cryptic message: on a memory stick, a photograph of the man who will soon assume command of DGSI, France's elite counterterrorism force. With that country reeling under a wave of ISIS attacks, Zavier Baland will be trusted to make the republic safe again. The problem - Slaton has seen Baland's face before. He is Ali Samir, a terrorist Slaton is certain he killed 15 years earlier. Unable to reconcile this frightening disconnect, he attempts to raise the alarm. </p> <p>Thousands of miles away, the chief information officer of ISIS tries to keep networks running amid crumbling infrastructure. With the caliphate's very survival at stake, the leadership commits to a last-ditch gambit: France must be attacked on a massive scale, forcing the West into the battle of the Apocalypse. </p> <p>Slaton keeps a breakneck pace, traveling to Tel Aviv, Paris, and the deserts of Syria. In the end he uncovers a labyrinthine plot - and one that only he can stop. </p>";
