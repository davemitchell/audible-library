window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>“One of the best thrillers you'll read this year.” (Lee Child, number-one </b><b><i>New York Times </i></b><b>best-selling author) </b></p> <p><b>No one knows what CIA desk jockey Zac Miller is capable of - including himself - until a routine surveillance job becomes a do-or-die mission in the Middle East. </b></p> <p>When a commercial flight violates restricted airspace to make an emergency landing at a closed airport in Iran, the passengers are just happy to be alive and ready to transfer to a functional plane. All of them except one...the American technology consultant in business class is not who he says he is. </p> <p>Zac Miller is a CIA analyst. And after an agent's cover gets blown, Zac - though never trained to be a field operative - volunteers to take his place, to keep a surveillance mission from being scrubbed. Zac thinks it will be easy to photograph the earthquake-ravaged airport that is located near a hidden top-secret nuclear facility. But when everything that can go wrong does, he finds himself on the run from the Islamic Revolutionary Guards and abandoned by his own teammates, who think he has gone rogue. </p> <p>Embarking on a harrowing journey through the mountains of Iran to the Persian Gulf and across Europe, Zac can only rely on himself. But even if he makes it out alive, the life he once had may be lost to him forever....</p>";
