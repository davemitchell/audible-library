By the trip's end, a crazed assassin would permanently disfigure Wes and kill Boyle. Now, eight years later, Boyle has been spotted alive. Trying to figure out what really happened takes Wes back into disturbing secrets buried in Freemason history, a decade-old presidential crossword puzzle, and a 200-year-old code invented by Thomas Jefferson that conceals secrets worth dying for.</p> <p>*Booktrack is an immersive format that pairs traditional audiobook narration to complementary music.
