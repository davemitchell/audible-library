As they sift through the disappearances, they get closer and closer to Curt Wad, who is more determined than ever to see the vision of his youth take hold and whose brutal treatment of Nete and others like her is only one small part of his capacity for evil. </p> <p> With <i>The Purity of Vengeance</i>, Jussi Adler-Olsen delivers a thrilling and shocking addition to his best-selling Department Q series. </p>";
