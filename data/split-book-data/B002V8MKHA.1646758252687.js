window.bookSummaryJSON = "In <i>Thunderstruck</i>, Erik Larson tells the interwoven stories of two men: Hawley Crippen, a very unlikely murderer, and Guglielmo Marconi, the obsessive creator of a seemingly supernatural means of communication. Their lives intersect during one of the greatest criminal chases of all time. <p>Set in Edwardian London and on the stormy coasts of Cornwall, Cape Cod, and Nova Scotia, <i>Thunderstruck</i> evokes the dynamism of those years when great shipping companies competed to build the biggest, fastest ocean liners; scientific advances dazzled the public with visions of a world transformed; and the rich outdid one another with ostentatious displays of wealth. Against this background, Marconi races against incredible odds and relentless skepticism to perfect his invention: the wireless, a prime catalyst for the emergence of the world we know today. Meanwhile, Crippen, \"the kindest of men\", nearly commits the perfect crime.</p> <p>With his superb narrative skills, Erik Larson guides these parallel narratives toward a relentlessly suspenseful meeting on the waters of the North Atlantic. Along the way, he tells of a sad and tragic love affair that was described on the front pages of newspapers around the world, a chief inspector who found himself strangely sympathetic to the killer and his lover, and a driven and compelling inventor who transformed the way we communicate.</p> <p><i>Thunderstruck</i> presents a vibrant portrait of an era of s√©ances, science, and fog, inhabited by inventors, magicians, and Scotland Yard detectives, all presided over by the amiable and fun-loving Edward VII as the world slid inevitably toward the first great war of the 20th century.</p> <p>Gripping from the start, and rich with fascinating detail about the time, the people, and the new inventions that connect and divide us, <i>Thunderstruck</i> is splendid narrative history from a master of the form.</p>";
