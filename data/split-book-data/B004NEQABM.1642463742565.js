window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Nicholai Hel - genius, mystic, and the perfect formidable assassin - was first introduced to listeners in </b><b><i>Shibumi</i></b><b>, the classic number one best seller by master storyteller Trevanian. Now critically acclaimed author Don Winslow continues Hel's story for the first time in this all-new, blockbuster thriller.</b></p> <p><b>Prepare to meet the world's most dangerous man....</b></p> <p>It is the fall of 1951, and the Korean War is raging. Twenty-six-year-old Nicholai Hel has spent the last three years in solitary confinement at the hands of the Americans. Hel is a master of hoda korosu, or \"naked kill,\" is fluent in seven languages, and has honed extraordinary \"proximity sense\" - an extra-awareness of the presence of danger. He has the skills to be the world's most fearsome assassin and now the CIA needs him.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Americans offer Hel freedom, money, and a neutral passport in exchange for one small service: to go to Beijing and kill the Soviet Union's commissioner to China. It's almost certainly a suicide mission, but Hel accepts. Now he must survive chaos, violence, suspicion, and betrayal while trying to achieve his ultimate goal of satori - the possibility of true understanding and harmony with the world.&nbsp;</p>";
