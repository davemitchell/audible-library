window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This riveting and entertaining thriller by Thomas Perry follows a husband-and-wife con team on the run from the Mob, a soldier of fortune between jobs, a two-bit operator with grandiose dreams of tribal dynasty, a sultry CIA operative with divided loyalties, the most dazzling defector ever to hurl a split-fingered fastball, and 20th-century buccaneers who wash up on a tiny island in the Caribbean and turn it into a multinational cash machine. But then the shooting starts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Somebody is trying to invade the island, and that somebody could be anybody: the CIA, NSC, or IRS; the most powerful, corrupt bank in the US or the South American cocaine mafia - or it could just be the Los Angeles incarnation of the devil himself, a shadowy figure with a checkered past named Fat Jimmy....</p>";
