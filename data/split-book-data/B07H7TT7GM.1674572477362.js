window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The Golden State Killer. The East Area Rapist. The Original Night Stalker. The Visalia Ransacker.</p> <p>The monster who preyed on Californians from 1976 to 1986 was known by many aliases. And while numerous police sketches tried to capture his often-masked visage, the Golden State Killer spent more than 40 years not only faceless, but nameless.</p> <p>For his victims, for their families and for the investigators tasked with finding him, the senselessness and brutality of the Golden State Killer's acts were matched only by the powerlessness they felt at failing to uncover his identity. To be sure, the chances of obtaining closure—or any form of justice—after so many years were slim to none, at best.</p> <p>Then, on April 24, 2018, authorities arrested 72-year-old Joseph James DeAngelo at his home in Citrus Heights, Calif., based on DNA evidence linked to the crimes. After a decades-long hunt, a suspect was behind bars. Could it be that evil finally had a name?</p> <p>Delivering all-new details about the investigation and a stunning final act to the events of Michelle McNamara's haunting bestseller, <i>I'll Be Gone in the Dark</i>, this is the true story of how the suspected Golden State Killer was captured, as told, first-hand, by those closest to the case:</p> <p>Paul Holes—the forensic criminologist and retired Costa County detective who spent 20 years trying to crack the Golden State Killer case, and finally did.</p> <p>Jim Clemente (Host)—a retired FBI profiler and former New York City prosecutor who has investigated some of the highest profile criminal cases in U.S. history, including the Unabomber.</p> <p><b>Please note: This work contains descriptions of violent crime and sexual assault and may not be suitable for all listeners.</b>&nbsp;</p>";
