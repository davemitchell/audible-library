window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Number One <i>New York Times</i> Best Seller • </p> <p>Number One <i>USA Today</i> Best Seller • </p> <p>Number One <i>Wall Street Journal</i> Best Seller •</p> <p>From number one <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Daniel Silva, this summer’s hottest thriller.</p> <p>Now you see her. </p> <p>Now you don’t. </p> <p><i>THE NEW GIRL</i>. </p> <p>A new thriller of deception, betrayal, and vengeance.</p> <p>She was covered from head to toe in expensive wool and plaid, the sort of stuff one saw at the Burberry boutique in Harrods. She carried a leather bookbag rather than a nylon backpack. Her patent leather ballet slippers were glossy and bright. She was proper, the new girl, modest. </p> <p>But there was something else about her....</p> <p>At an exclusive private school in Switzerland, mystery surrounds the identity of the beautiful raven-haired girl who arrives each morning in a motorcade fit for a head of state. She is said to be the daughter of a wealthy international businessman. In truth, her father is Khalid bin Mohammed, the much-maligned crown prince of Saudi Arabia. Once celebrated for his daring social and religious reforms, he is now reviled for his role in the murder of a dissident journalist. And when his only child is brutally kidnapped, he turns to the one man he can trust to find her before it is too late.</p> <p>What’s done cannot be undone....</p> <p>Gabriel Allon, the legendary chief of Israeli intelligence, has spent most of his life fighting terrorists, including the murderous jihadists financed by Saudi Arabia. Prince Khalid - or KBM, as he is known - has pledged to finally break the bond between the Kingdom and radical Islam. For that reason alone, Gabriel regards him as a valuable, if flawed, partner. Together, they will become unlikely allies in a deadly secret war for control of the Middle East. The life of a child, and the throne of Saudi Arabia, hang in the balance. Both men have made their share of enemies. And both have everything to lose.</p> <p>Filled with dark humor, breathtaking twists of plot, and an unforgettable cast of characters, <i>The New Girl</i> is both a thrilling, pause-resisting tale of entertainment and a sophisticated study of political alliances and great-power rivalries in a dangerous world. And it is once again proof that Gabriel Allon is “one of fiction’s greatest spies” (<i>Kirkus</i>) and Daniel Silva is “quite simply the best” (<i>Kansas City Star</i>) writer of foreign intrigue and suspense at work today. </p>";
