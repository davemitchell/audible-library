window.bookSummaryJSON = "Includes the short stories \"The Hound\" and \"The Festival\" <p>H. P. Lovecraft is considered to be one of the most influential horror and fantasy writers of the 20th century. His work is frequently compared to the likes of Edgar Allan Poe, and explored the idea that life is incomprehensible to human minds and that the universe is fundamentally alien.</p> <p>\"The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity; and it was not meant that we should voyage far.\"</p> <p>\"The Call of Cthulhu\", written in 1926, is probably Lovecraft's best-known work. Discovering notes left by a deceased relative, the narrator pieces together the whole truth and disturbing significance of the Cthulhu cult. This release also contains the shorter tales \"The Festival\" and \"The Hound\", in which gravediggers bring home more than they bargained for!</p> <p>Gareth David-Lloyd has appeared the second series of the BBC sci-fi series <i>Torchwood</i>.
