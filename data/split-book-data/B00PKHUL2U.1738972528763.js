window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>It's been over a decade since Verne Harnish's best-selling book <i>Mastering the Rockefeller Habits</i> was first released. <i>Scaling Up: How a Few Companies Make It...and Why the Rest Don't</i> is the first major revision of this business classic. In <i>Scaling Up, Harnish</i> and his team share practical tools and techniques for building an industry-dominating business. These approaches have been honed from over three decades of advising tens of thousands of CEOs and executives and helping them navigate the increasing complexities (and weight) that come with scaling up a venture. </p> <p>This book is written so everyone - from front line employees to senior executives - can get aligned in contributing to the growth of a firm. There's no reason to do it alone, yet many top leaders feel like they are the ones dragging the rest of the organization up the S-curve of growth. The goal of this book is to help you turn what feels like an anchor into wind at your back - creating a company where the team is engaged; the customers are doing your marketing; and everyone is making money. To accomplish this, <i>Scaling Up</i> focuses on the four major decision areas every company must get right: People, Strategy, Execution, and Cash. </p> <p>The book includes a series of new one-page tools including the updated One-Page Strategic Plan and the Rockefeller Habits ChecklistTM, which more than 40,000 firms around the globe have used to scale their companies successfully - many to $1 billion and beyond. Running a business is ultimately about freedom. <i>Scaling Up</i> shows business leaders how to get their organizations moving in sync to create something significant and enjoy the ride. Bonus material for <i>Scaling Up</i> may be found at www.ScalingUp.com. </p>";
