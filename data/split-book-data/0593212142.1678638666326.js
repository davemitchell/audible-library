window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best seller</b></p> <p><b>Winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award</b></p> <p><b>\"Of all the stories that argue and speculate about Shakespeare’s life...here is a novel...so gorgeously written that it transports you.\" (</b><b><i>The Boston Globe</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p>In&nbsp;1580s England, during the Black Plague, a young Latin tutor falls in love with an extraordinary, eccentric young woman in this “exceptional historical novel” (<i>The New Yorker</i>) and best-selling winner of the Women’s Prize for Fiction. Agnes is a wild creature who walks her family’s land with a falcon on her glove and is known throughout the countryside for her unusual gifts as a healer, understanding plants and potions better than she does people. Once she settles with her husband on Henley Street in Stratford-upon-Avon, she becomes a fiercely protective mother and a steadfast, centrifugal force in the life of her young husband, whose career on the London stage is taking off when his beloved young son succumbs to sudden fever.</p> <p>A luminous portrait of a marriage, a shattering evocation of a family ravaged by grief and loss, and a tender and unforgettable reimagining of a boy whose life has been all but forgotten, and whose name was given to one of the most celebrated plays of all time, <i>Hamnet </i>is mesmerizing, seductive, impossible to pause - a magnificent leap forward from one of our most gifted novelists.</p>";
