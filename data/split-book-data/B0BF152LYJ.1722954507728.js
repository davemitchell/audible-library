window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"Pratt's richly developed characters are vivid and believable, especially the strong Southern women who fight their male-dominated culture from behind a facade of vulnerability.\" (</b><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p><b>Books one through four in Scott Pratt's iconic Joe Dillard series are offered in a bundle.</b></p> <p><i>An Innocent Client</i>: In this best-selling debut, criminal defense lawyer Joe Dillard has become jaded over the years as he's tried to balance his career against his conscience. Savvy but cynical, Dillard wants to quit doing criminal defense, but he can't resist the chance to represent someone who might actually be innocent. His drug-addicted sister has just been released from prison and his mother is succumbing to Alzheimer's, but Dillard's commitment to the case never wavers despite the personal troubles and professional demands that threaten to destroy him.</p> <p><i>In Good Faith</i>: In the second book of the iconic Joe Dillard series, it's up to newly minted prosecutor Joe Dillard to convict Satan-worshipping teens accused of committing heinous crimes. A former defense attorney who spent way too much time defending people he knew were guilty, Joe is determined to win this case to atone for his past. But an evil young woman named Natasha is responsible for the slayings, and Joe knows it. Natasha is walking around free because the two boys who have been arrested are too terrified to implicate her. Now Joe must risk everything—including his family's safety and his own life—to bring an evil murderer to justice.</p> <p><i>Injustice For All</i>: In the third book of the best-selling Joe Dillard series, Dillard finds himself in the middle of two volatile mysteries. The primary suspect in a local judge's murder is Dillard's son's best friend, and Dillard's wife may have destroyed evidence. Meanwhile, a missing girl turns out to be a mystery far deeper than anyone imagined....</p> <p><i>Reasonable Fear</i>: In the fourth installment of the best-selling Joe Dillard series, Dillard has become the district attorney in Northeast Tennessee. He becomes heavily involved in a local murder investigation with Sheriff Leon Bates and soon realizes that he is up against an enemy that he has never before encountered—someone so rich and so powerful that the course of justice could be altered by money and political influence. But when bodies start showing up in his driveway and his family is threatened with termination, Dillard must ask himself how far he's willing to go. His life, and the lives of his family, depend on the answer.</p> <p><b>All four of the novels are consistently among the top 25 best sellers in legal thrillers, and all four are among the most highly rated novels on Amazon. Enjoy an incredible value that will offer you more than 30 hours of pleasure and entertainment.</b></p>";
