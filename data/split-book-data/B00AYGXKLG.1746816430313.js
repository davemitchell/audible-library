window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Retired Delta Force officer Brad Taylor returns with the third explosive installment in the Pike Logan thrillers. </b></p> <p>In retired Delta Force officer Brad Taylor’s third Pike Logan thriller, a tentative peace between Israel and Palestine has been brokered by the United States. But the Taskforce - a clandestine team operating outside of US law to protect the country from terrorism - gets wind of an assassination attempt on the American envoy sent to solidify the treaty. The Taskforce must devote every resource to saving his life - and preventing another bloody outbreak of violence. </p> <p>Taskforce operator Pike Logan and his partner, Jennifer Cahill, are charged with following the assassin’s flimsy trail through the Middle East, a trail that becomes more muddled at every turn. They must contend with terrorist organizations, independent killers, and shaky allies to uncover the biggest threat of all: an American citizen hiding a secret that just may destroy everything, including the Taskforce. </p> <p>Brad Taylor is the complete package: a writer who understands how to tell a thrilling story, who possesses the knowledge to construct an intricate and utterly believable plot, and who has more than enough on-the-ground experience to back it up. His first two books appeared on best seller lists nationwide, including <i>The New York Times, Publishers Weekly, </i>and <i>USA Today.</i> Propulsive and compelling, <i>Enemy of Mine</i> is sure to join them.</p>";
