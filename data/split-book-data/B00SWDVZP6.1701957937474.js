Suspected of murder and marked for death by a network of conspirators embedded in the White House, Quinn knows he has to get out of the country--fast--before a team of contract killers find him and his daughter. To set things right at home, he'll have to take a nonstop flight from Anchorage, Alaska, to Vladivostok, Russia, aboard a massive Airbus A380. But soon after takeoff, it becomes apparent that Quinn and his daughter picked the wrong plane. First a passenger is brutally murdered. Then Quinn is mistaken for a terrorist by an off-duty air marshal. </p> <p>As panic spreads through the plane and pressure builds to the screaming point, the unthinkable happens. Someone triggers a bomb.... Spoiler alert: This plane is in big trouble.</p>";
