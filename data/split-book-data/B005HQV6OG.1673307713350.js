But then an unexpected gift wins him a scholarship to an exclusive boys' school, and his life will never be the same again.</p> <p>As he enters into adulthood, Harry finally learns how his father really died, but the awful truth only leads him to question, was he even his father? Is he the son of Arthur Clifton, a stevedore who spent his whole life on the docks, or the firstborn son of a scion of West Country society, whose family owns a shipping line?</p> <p>This introductory novel in Archer's ambitious series The Clifton Chronicles includes a cast of colorful characters and takes us from the ravages of the Great War to the outbreak of the Second World War, when Harry must decide whether to take up a place at Oxford or join the navy and go to war with Hitler's Germany.&nbsp;</p> <p>From the docks of working-class England to the bustling streets of 1940 New York City, <i>Only Time Will Tell </i>takes listeners on a journey through to future volumes, which will bring to life 100 years of recent history to reveal a family story that neither the listener nor Harry Clifton himself could ever have imagined.&nbsp;</p>";
