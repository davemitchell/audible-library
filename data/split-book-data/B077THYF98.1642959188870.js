window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Then</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>Fifteen years ago, an unidentified killer terrorised Northern Georgia, killing hikers with two shots from a pistol before disposing of the bodies along the remote trails and in the rivers in the vicinity of Blood Mountain. The killer was never brought to justice.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Now</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>Carter Blake has returned home for the first time in many years. The visit stirs old memories, including a girl from school who vanished without a trace. Blake runs into the mother of the girl, who mentions a case she's come across in Georgia, where someone is convinced their relative is still alive, 15 years on. Adeline Connor was the Blood Mountain Killer's last suspected victim. She vanished without a trace. So why is her brother so convinced she's still alive?&nbsp;</p>";
