window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From bestselling author J. B. Turner comes a deadly mission for Jon Reznick—but when the target is a master of disinformation, finding him might be harder than killing him.</b></p> <p>Black-ops specialist Jon Reznick is hoping for some well-earned down time under the Florida sun when he gets a surprise call from the CIA. An embittered US counterintelligence expert is about to sell a career’s worth of state secrets to the Russians, and the Agency wants Reznick to track him down.</p> <p>With the spook holed up somewhere in the diplomatic cauldron of the Middle East, protected by highly trained Russian mercenaries, Reznick knows it’s almost certainly a suicide mission. But with tough Scot Mac McCafferty and cybersecurity genius Trevelle Williams to back him up, patriot Reznick is soon racing across the region in pursuit of the target.</p> <p>Time is ticking and death is a strong possibility, but with stakes this high, for Jon Reznick there are no rules that can’t be broken…and failure is <i>never</i> an option.</p>";
