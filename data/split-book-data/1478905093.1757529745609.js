Who better to connect the crimes and foil a daringly brilliant plot than Simon Riske, freelance industrial spy? </p> <p>Riske - part Bond, part Reacher - knows Monte Carlo well: It's where he was once a thrill-seeking thief himself, robbing armored trucks and leading police on dangerous car chases across the CÃ´te d'Azur, until he was double-crossed, served his time, and graduated as an investment genius from the Sorbonne.</p> <p>Now, Riske is a man who solves problems, the bigger and \"riskier\" the better. From the baccarat tables of Europe's finest casinos to the superyachts moored in Monaco's Port Hercule to a secluded chalet deep in the Swiss Alps, Riske will do what he does best: get in over his head, throw himself into danger, and find a way to outthink and outmaneuver villains of every stripe. </p> <p>In one of the most clever, enjoyable, and entertaining new series to come along in years, this sequel to <i>The Take</i> gives listeners what they want most: a hero we can root for, locales we wish we were in, and a plot that never lets up.</p>";
