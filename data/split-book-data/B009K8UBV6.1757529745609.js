window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Dashiell Hammett was a crime writer who elevated the genre to true literature, and <i>The Thin Man</i> was Hammett’s last - and most successful - novel. Following the enormous success of <i>The Thin Man</i> movie in 1934, Hammett was commissioned to write stories for additional films. He wrote two full-length novellas for the films that became <i>After the Thin Man</i> and <i>Another Thin Man</i>. Hammett brought back his classic characters - retired private investigator Nick Charles and his former debutante wife Nora - in these two fully satisfying <i>Thin Man</i> stories, written with Hammett’s signature, barbed dialogue. </p> <p>Neither of these stories has been previously published (except for a partial in a small magazine 25 years ago). Now together in <i>Return of the Thin Man</i>, these hugely entertaining novellas are destined to remain essential listening for Hammett’s millions of fans and a new generation of mystery lovers the world over. </p> <p>The recording features Peter Ganim as Nick, Nicola Barber as Nora, and Scott Brick as the narrator. Additional character voices are provided by Emily Bauer, Dan Bittner, Cynthia Darlow, Richard Ferrone, Eliza Foss, Emma Galvin, Johnny Heller, Pete Larkin, Bill Lobley, Carol Monda, Rich Orlow, Paula Parker, Vinnie Penna, with Zane Birdwell, Nathan Rosborough, Iris McElroy, Barbara Vlahides, Fametta Sawyer, Tim Bader, Tyrrell Harrell, Kevin Fecu, and Alan Winter. </p>";
