window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>One of the most talented and creative authors working today, Neal Stephenson is renowned for his exceptional novels - works colossal in vision and mind-boggling in complexity. Exploring and blending a diversity of topics, including technology, economics, history, science, pop culture, and philosophy, his books are the products of a keen and adventurous intellect. Not surprisingly, Stephenson is regularly asked to contribute articles, lectures, and essays to numerous outlets, from major newspapers and cutting-edge magazines to college symposia. This remarkable collection brings together previously published short writings, both fiction and nonfiction, as well as a new essay (and an extremely short story) created specifically for this volume.&nbsp;</p> <p>Stephenson ponders a wealth of subjects, from movies and politics to David Foster Wallace and the Midwestern American College Town; video games to classics-based sci-fi; how geekdom has become cool and how science fiction has become mainstream (whether people admit it or not); the future of publishing and the origins of his novels. Playful and provocative, <i>Some Remarks</i> displays Stephenson's opinions and ideas on&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li>The Internet, our dwindling national attention span, and the cultural importance of books and bookishness;&nbsp;</li> <li>Waco, religion, and the cluelessness of secular society;&nbsp;</li> <li>Metaphysics and the battle between Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz;&nbsp;</li> <li>The laying of the longest wire on Earth - and why it matters to you;&nbsp;</li> <li>Technology, freedom, commerce, and the Chinese;&nbsp;</li> <li>How <i>Star Wars</i> and <i>300</i> mirror who we are today and what that spells for our future; and&nbsp;</li> <li>Modern Jedi knights, a.k.a. scientists and technologists, and why they are admired and feared by both the left and the right.</li> </ul> <p>By turns amusing and profound, critical and celebratory, yet always entertaining, <i>Some Remarks</i> offers a fascinating look into the prismatic mind of this extraordinary writer.</p>";
