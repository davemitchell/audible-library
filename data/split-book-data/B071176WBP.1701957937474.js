But he's no ordinary gun for hire. Smith is a man of rare gifts, including the ability to read minds. Arriving at the wedding of Kira Sadeghi, a reality television celebrity he recently saved from kidnappers, Smith witnesses a group of gunmen open fire, hitting the bride and others. Though he's unarmed, Smith cripples one of the killers and is able to pry one word from his mind: \"downvote\". </p> <p>Eager to learn more, Smith hacks into the brain of an FBI agent investigating the attack to discover the bureau has been investigating a nefarious new threat called Downvote, an encrypted site on the dark net that lists the names of celebrities and offers a hefty bounty for anyone who can kill them - unleashing an anonymous and deadly flashmob with a keystroke. </p> <p>Finding a mastermind on the Internet is like trying to catch air - unless you're John Smith. Motivated by money and revenge, he traces a series of electronic signatures to a reclusive billionaire living at sea, accompanied by a scary-smart female bodyguard who becomes Smith's partner in his quest. The hunt for their prey will lead from Hong Kong to Reykjavik to a luxury gambling resort deep in the Laotian jungle. Yet always this criminal mastermind remains one step ahead. </p> <p>The only way Downvote's creator can stop Smith is to kill him...because while this diabolical genius can run, there's no hiding from a man who can read minds. </p>";
