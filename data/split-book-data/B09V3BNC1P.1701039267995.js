All three are run with an iron first by The Chief, a giant with a gigantic IQ. His top agent is Alex Mason, hard and cool - he's a law unto himself.</p> <p>But when an ODIN 5i agent based at the US Embassy in Manila goes missing and his encrypted laptop disappears with him, the whole ODIN structure is put in peril. Then the agents he was managing start to disappear one by one, and things start to look ugly.</p> <p>So Alex Mason is sent to Manila, and what he finds there is the growing shadow of Chinese imperialism threatening not only Americaâ€™s presence in the Pacific, but the security of the whole Western world....</p> <p>This is a job for ODIN 1i...and for Alex Mason.</p>";
