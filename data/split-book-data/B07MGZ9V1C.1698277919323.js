It happened at the excavation site where a murderer had buried his victims’ remains. In custody is a forensic technician in shock, with no history of aggression. He doesn’t remember a thing. His colleagues don’t even recognize the man they thought they knew. But an MRI reveals something peculiar. And abnormal.&nbsp;</p> <p>What on earth made him commit murder?&nbsp;</p> <p>After discovering that a mysterious man has been stalking crime scenes and stealing forensic data, Cray has a radical and terrifying theory.
