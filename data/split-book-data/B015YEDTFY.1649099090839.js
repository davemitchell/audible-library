window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Bury your enemies, and bury them deep. </p> <p>John Milton thought he was done with Avi Bachman. The most dangerous man he's ever known has been incarcerated in Angola, the brutal Louisiana prison. Inmates rarely leave Angola. Once you go in, the only way out is in a box. But Bachman is no ordinary prisoner. He was an assassin for the Mossad, and he has favours to call in. </p> <p>Milton is in the Australian outback with an old friend and his flirtatious kid sister, looking for a summer’s peace to put his troubled mind to rest. But Bachman has other plans. He thinks that Milton killed his wife, and now he wants revenge. </p> <p>From Australia to Israel, from Hong Kong to Croatia, here is the conclusion of this brutal chapter in Milton’s life. The two headhunters are on a collision course, and only one of them will walk away. Don’t start this audiobook in bed - you will lose sleep. </p> <p>Mark Dawson has worked as a lawyer and currently works in the London film industry. His first books, <i>The Art of Falling Apart</i> and <i>Subpoena Colada</i> have been published in multiple languages. He is currently writing three series. </p> <p>The John Milton series features a disgruntled assassin who aims to help people make amends for the things he has done. </p> <p>The Beatrix Rose series features the headlong fight for justice of a wronged mother - who happens to be an assassin - against the six names on her kill list. </p> <p>Soho Noir is set in the West End of London between 1940 and 1970. The first book in the series, <i>The Black Mile</i>, deals with the (real-life but little-known) serial killer who operated in the area during the Blitz. <i>The Imposter</i> traces the journey of a criminal family through the period; it has been compared to <i>The Sopranos</i> in austerity London. </p>";
