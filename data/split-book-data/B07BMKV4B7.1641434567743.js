window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of <i>Magpie Murders</i> and <i>Moriarty</i> brilliantly reinvents the classic crime novel once again with this clever and inventive mystery starring a fictional version of the author himself as the Watson to a modern-day Holmes, investigating a case involving buried secrets, murder, and a trail of bloody clues.</p> <p>A woman crosses a London street.</p> <p>It is just after 11 a.m. on a bright spring morning, and she is going into a funeral parlor to plan her own service.</p> <p>Six hours later the woman is dead, strangled with a crimson curtain cord in her own home.</p> <p>Enter disgraced police detective Daniel Hawthorne, a brilliant, eccentric man as quick with an insult as he is to crack a case. And Hawthorne has a partner, the celebrated novelist Anthony Horowitz, curious about the case and looking for new material.</p> <p>As brusque, impatient, and annoying as Hawthorne can be, Horowitz - a seasoned hand when it comes to crime stories - suspects the detective may be on to something, and is irresistibly drawn into the mystery. But as the case unfolds, Horowitz realizes he’s at the center of a story he can’t control...and that his brilliant partner may be hiding dark and mysterious secrets of his own.</p> <p>A masterful and tricky mystery which plays games at many levels, <i>The Word Is Murder</i> is Anthony Horowitz at his very best.</p>";
