For more than a decade, Jane pursued her unusual profession: \"I'm a guide...I show people how to go from places where somebody is trying to kill them to other places where nobody is.\" Then she promised her husband she would never work again and settled in to live a happy, quiet life as Jane McKinnon, the wife of a surgeon in Amherst, New York. <p>But when a bomb goes off in the middle of a hospital fundraiser, Jane finds herself face to face with the cause of the explosion: a young pregnant girl who has been tracked across the country by a team of hired hunters.That night, regardless of what she wants or the vow that she's made to her husband, Jane must come back to transform one more victim into a runner. And her quest for safety sets in motion a mission that will be a rescue operation - or a chance for revenge.</p>";
