As he reflects on his days, the lives of his family continue to unfold, unravel, and intertwine in ways no one could have imagined . . .<br> <br> Harry’s wife Emma, who just completed her time at the Bristol Royal Infirmary, receives a surprise call from Margaret Thatcher. Meanwhile, Giles Barrington discovers a shocking truth about his wife, Karin. Sebastian Clifton becomes chairman of Farthings Kaufman bank, but only after Hakim Bishara’s abrupt resignation. Sebastian’s daughter Jessica is expelled from school, but her aunt Grace comes to the rescue. And Lady Virginia, who is set to flee the country to avoid her creditors, finds an opportunity to clear her debts after the Duchess of Hertford dies—and a way to finally trump the Cliftons and Barringtons.</p>";
