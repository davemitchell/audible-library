window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"Ray Porter is the perfect book narrator. He submerges so completely into each character that they come alive as individuals. He allows the story to speak rather than making it ‘his’. He’s also fun to work with –and we have done a ton of projects together. It’s to the point that I hear his voice in my head when I’m writing. And even though he’s reading my work, his performance is so nuanced and entertaining that it allows me to listen to my own audiobooks as if they are brand new. It’s a fantastic working partnership.\" Jonathan Maberry on Ray Porter</b></p> <p><b>Joe Ledger and Rogue Team International plunge into mortal peril as this new and deadly arms race threatens to ignite new wars throughout the Middle East.</b><br> <br> After years of searching, a new cave filled with Dead Sea Scrolls is found, and among them are bizarre books of actual magic. Terrorist groups and multinational corporations scramble to acquire these treasures in the hopes that magic is the true WMD of the 21st Century. But everyone who goes near those scrolls goes insane. The fabric of reality is shredding. Is this the result of ancient magic, or is it a new bioweapon that fractures the mind of anyone exposed?<br> <br> Cave 13 pits Joe Ledger against warring factions of ideological terrorism, corporate greed, and massive international crime syndicates in what might well become a new Age of Miracles.<br> <b><br> A Macmillan Audio production from St. Martin's Griffin.</b></p>";
