Alone and directionless, he faces at last a shadow he has lived with since his childhood: what made his father, a respected police officer, apparently shoot dead two unarmed teens and then commit suicide. His quest leads him back to the little New York town where he grew up, to the mysterious history of the NYPD, and to the existence of secret friends and hidden enemies. And waiting in the shadows, as they have been throughout Charlieâ€™s life, are a man and a woman with only one purpose: to bring an end to his very existence.</b></p>";
