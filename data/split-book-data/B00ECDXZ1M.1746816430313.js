window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Audie Award Finalist, Original Work, 2014</b></p> <p><b>Audibleâ€™s Audie Award-winning and Hugo Award-nominated vision of the not-too-distant future returns! </b></p> <p>As <i>METAtropolis: Green Space</i> moves into the 22nd Century, human social evolution is heading in new directions after the Green Crash and the subsequent Green Renaissance. Nearly everyone who cares to participate in the wired world has become part of the \"Internet of things\", a virtual environment mapped across all aspects of the natural experience. At the same time, the serious back-to-the-land types have embraced a full-on paleo lifestyle, including genetically engineering themselves and their offspring. At the same time, a back-to-space movement is seeking the moon, a green Mars, and even the stars, with the eventual goal of leaving a pristine and undisturbed Earth behind. <i>METAtropolis: Green Space</i> is the creation of Hugo and World Fantasy Award nominee Jay Lake; Hugo Award winning writers Seanan McGuire, Mary Robinette Kowal, and Elizabeth Bear; <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Tobias S. Buckell; Aurora Award winner Karl Schroeder; and critically-acclaimed author Ken Scholes.</p>";
